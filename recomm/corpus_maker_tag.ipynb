       "[' The Secret Garden within Changdeokgung I have been to Changdeokgung and the Secret Garden twice now. The best times to go would be in the springtime when all the flowers are in full bloom and the garden is alive with bird song. Autumn is also amazing as the fall foliage looks splendid as it complements the palace buildings. It is one of the five grand palaces within Seoul and is conveniently located nearby other popular tourist attractions. There is a separate entrance fee for Changdeokgung palace and the Secret Garden which boasts pavilions  lily ponds  a stream as well as luscious vegetation. You may only enter the Secret Garden as part of an organised tour. The tours are in Korean  English  Japanese  Chinese. For more detailed information and for many photographs please have a look at my blog post                                           ',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden is worth a visit We visited the Secret Garden  and we had the most loveliest guide  Ms Yoon! We chatted a lots after the tour and she was very interested about our home country and our view about Korea. Secret Garden tour is included in the palace pass  but you need to get a separate ticket before entry at the ticket counter near the gates. This is because the tour holds only 50 people at a time and there are language options  English  Korean  Chinese and if I remember correctly Japanese . Palace pass  tickets for all 5 main palace areas Secret Garden  is 10 000 won.',\n",
       " ' Nice place It is a very charming place  the little lake with white water lily. Well maintained place. You have chance to try their traditional dress for photo as well which was fun. I love the architect of this place very much ',\n",
       " ' Interesting tour Interesting tour but be sure to have a guide if you want to get the most out of it. Lots of teens wearing traditional clothes that like having their picture taken.',\n",
       " ' Recommended for those who like history It is good maintained  large  can let you feel the background of The country. I like Vietnam palace more so that I rate 3 points for it.',\n",
       " ' Another Korean masterpiece Excellent example of royal architecture for the Joseon period. Well worth visiting to soak up the historical atmosphere and to see how royalty lived.',\n",
       " ' Short visit but was nice You wont need too much time here   just a overall look not more than 30 minutes. This is the most important sign of seoul when you visit . Great place for history lovers. You can also find some tour leaders to receive detailed information. ',\n",
       " ' no must I went there after visiting the Gyeongbokgung palace and for me they look very similar. I can t even distinguish my pictures being taken in both palaces. Maybe the secret garden would have been more interesting  but the ticket for the garden was a little bit too expensive. I was really bored walking around this palace and took about 10 pictures. I think i needed less than 1 hour. If you have already seen one palace  you can skip this one. The same thing i had to criticize about the Gyeongbokgung  You can never enter the rooms or make a good picture from the intererior.',\n",
       " ' lovely Built in 1405 as a secondary palace with a secret garden. I recommend visiting both the palace and the garden. You must have a tour guide for the garden so plan according to tour times. It is quite breathtaking. ',\n",
       " ' A tradition design palace Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997  it is closed to Buckon Hanok Village  we can walk from metro station of Anguk exit No.3 around 7 10min  very easy to found  you can spend 3 4 hours on Changdeokgung and Buckon Hanok Village together. Nearby it also have Gyeongbokgung  No. 1 palace in Korea.',\n",
       " ' No We spent hours walking around to see where the King lived and where his wife lived  etc.! Beautiful architecture  but no furniture to mention or much else. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Palace This palace is really underrated for its beauty. During my second visit to Korea  I went to Changdeokgung and realised that it was so much more beautiful than Gyeongbukgong. Also  It was much better to take pictures hanbok photos as it is less crowded. I missed out on the secret garden because of itinerary constraints but I would urge people to visit the garden during their visit because it is magnificent.',\n",
       " ' Is magical This enormous palace is good to see in a sunny day. Be ready to walk a lot and if u want to see it all  be there a few hours. There is free tour guides provided and the entrance is only  3 p p. Bring camera  sunscreen and comfy shoes. ',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung palace 500 years old palace mainly made from wood. Amazing Korean design with beautiful colours. It is recommended to visi Changdeokgung palace ',\n",
       " ' Do not miss secret garden.. The place is one of the few historical monuments in the city. It  s pictoresque and if you get beautiful weather it  s a pleasure to walk in. Do not miss secret garden which is the most beautiful and interesting part to visit. Guides in typical korean ancoent costume. ',\n",
       " ' Moonlight tour It was interesting to visit the palace at night  but the number of lit up places was very limited. I wish I had gone there during the day instead.',\n",
       " ' Pleasant morning A couple of hours tops is what you should spend here. They have a lovely garden and the changing of the guard is good to see. ',\n",
       " ' Is ok. Overall i find the Palace in Korea a bit too boring.Is all a shell other than that nothing much to see and everything thing looks the same. Is a shame when you look into the room is either empty or pretty dull. You want to see the richness of it during those days.I reacon they cold do much better. Only highlight i got was the delicious cold Citroen Tea you can buy at the giftshop.That was a really nice drink freshly made lemon tea with pieces of preserved lemons. Loved it.',\n",
       " ' Spectacular and Colorful This is one of the most favored palace by the kings from all other palaces. More colorful  amazing structures  the Secret Garden  makes the place really special. The secret garden tour is a must here. The overall place is big and lots of history to catch. Very near from Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukchon village ',\n",
       " ' The best out of the palaces in Seoul! Changdeokgung has a secret garden which makes it worth the visit. We booked tickets online the day before  which might be neccessary as it might sell out during high season. I would advise to try and go early or later i the afternoon as it was a bit too hot to go mid day in mid August. The palace itself and the surrounding buildings are similar to the other palaces in Seoul  however a walk around the secret garden was very nice and made it stand out from the others. If I remember correctly we were told that the lotus flowers bloom in early September so I guess this would be the best time to go  in order to enjoy the full beauty of the Secret Garden.',\n",
       " ' Great place to visit A great day out for wandering through Korean history. We bought the multi venue ticket which allowed us to visit this palace  including the secret garden  the Jongmyo Shrine  Changgyeonggung Palace  Gyeongokgung Palace and Deoksugung Palace. It cost 10 000 Won. It s worth it if you are going to visit all the places as it costs about 3000 to visit each palace and 1000 to visit the shrine on individual tickets. The grounds are fairly large and we spent the whole morning there. We also visited the secret garden which is lovely but as its only at certain times there were a lot of people and I would have liked to have spent more time there. If you have the ticket book  you can access the Changgyeonggung Palace from this one and save yourself the long walk around to the entrance on the other side. This access is near where the secret garden tour starts. If you haven t got a ticket  there is a ticket booth there so you can still get in. ',\n",
       " ' Ancient..... First thing when you get there....prepare your energy....very big palace with the beautiful secret garden.... This place is easy to found...near angguk station n insadong street.... Quite place for relax..... ',\n",
       " ' Historic Experience Changdeokgung Palace was an amazing place to visit. It is easily accessed by the subway station. Inside the palace there are several buildings monuments and even an art gallery open for viewing. If you re there for a specific time you can watch as the palace guards rotate. They also offer the option of wearing traditional Korean garments for free  and within a time limit .',\n",
       " ' Don t miss The most beautiful sceneries I ve seen in Seoul. A huge garden  do the Secret Garden tour   about 6 euros  with architecture of the palace objects fitting the surroundings in a beautiful fashion. Everything sits together perfectly in a picturesque way. This was in summer   it gets even prettier in autumn or winter  we ve seen pictures .    And the tour guide was a Korean lady with the best English I ve heard in this whole week I spent in Seoul  this helps a lot if you wanna hear the explanations .',\n",
       " ' A place of ancient Korea and its history come alive! Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Jongno gu in Seoul. It is one of the  Five Grand Palaces  built by the kings during the Joseon Dynasty. And as such  it was the principal palace for many of the Joseon kings and a 600 year old UNESCO World Heritage Site. We were here for a visit as part of our full day city tour. We arrived at around 9.30am and stayed there for slightly over an hour. It was not crowded when we arrived  perhaps it was still early  and our admission fees had been included in our package tour. But I understand that the admission fee is 3 000 won per adult. The palace ground was massive  with many  interlinked  palace buildings from one to another with a big open compound. Of course what was interesting was the ancient style of architectural design and to some extent  similar to the Chinese style. According to our guide  both ancient China and Korea were good allies and thus the country had some influences from the Chinese culture.  in fact  on the roof top of some buildings were designs of the Chinese classic novel  Journey to the West  with the Monkey God  the Tripitaka Master etc  cool!  Maintenance and conservation work of the buildings had been done here by the city authorities. So we walked from one building to another  with some being able to enter or taking a look from outside on the interior structure of the palaces  such as the King s chair and office  paintings etc! Along the way  we also saw some people wearing the traditional Korean Hanbok costumes  very nice  colourful and lovely  And you are keen  you can try them out too! As we need to visit several attractions in our tour  we were not able to stay to visit the Secret Gardens which according to our guide  was very beautiful and nice! For us  the visit here was generally fine and interesting to learn about the ancient culture of Korea though we would love to see more like in Gyeongbukgung Palace. Weather was very sunny and warm and do remember to bring along an umbrella  hat and drinking water. Well  if you are planning to visit some palaces in your trip here  Changdeokgung Palace is also a good option besides the Gyeongbukgung  though the latter has much more to see  besides the buildings and gardens  bigger  there is also an ancient  change of guard  ceremony. But do take note that the former is closed on Mondays and the latter is closed on Tuesdays!',\n",
       " ' beautiful palace with my family  even though it was so hot day during Aug  but from time to time  can feel windy and it was not that huge like Gyeongbokgung  and building and history was fascinating enough to attract our attention! Something not good is only there was not enough parking space around this palace',\n",
       " ' Average with interesting architecture We came here because the other bigger palace was closed on Tuesday. It was okay  nothing too special in my opinion. But the architect was interesting. It s 3000 won entrance fee and you have to pay extra for the secret garden  which I think is what everyone wants to see. It s another 2000 won and you can only go as part of a guided tour. There is not much shade so it s pretty hot on a summer s day. Bukchon Village and Insadong Street are close by. ',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Palace Best advice  Tour around with a tour guide. Tour guide is free you just have to wait for their schedules. They offer Chinese  English  Japanese and Korean languages. You can check also their website which is very helpful! Tour guides are very passionate they will make you love Korea!! 3',\n",
       " ' New Building Never occupied by the King Nice structures  but a recreation that is only about 15 years old. So the King never sleep here  not have the buildings ever been truly occupied.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace This is a beautiful place. If you watch historical Korean dramas you have to go here. This is one of the palaces in the stories. ',\n",
       " ' saw the ceremony we went at around 930 am and were hustled into the inner yard. there was the ceremonial precession right behind us. The whole thing takes about an hour and they ask you to stay so you don t interrupt  but you can leave. we stayed for about 30 minutes and it was a neat opportunity to see a historic offering take place. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful place I went there with my old parents just yesterday. Another thing to add in your must see list. Personally  I find Gyeongbokgung more beautiful but the Secret Garden tour in this palace is something you should not miss. ',\n",
       " ' Experience the true relic of Joseon dynasty Amazing! Don t forget to buy the ticket to secret garden too. Along with the official english language tour guide  immerse yourself with true history of the past Joseon.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful part of history When you re in Seoul you should see this palace. It s in the heart of Seoul and close to many other things. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Palace!!! Must Visit!! I enjoyed visiting this gorgeous palace. It has so much architecture and history! The day we went was free entrance and we only had to pay for the English guided garden tour which lasted an hour. When visiting you can see some Koreans dressed in traditional clothes. It can be very humid and hot so stay hydrated! Also  you can take beautiful pictures so I recommend bringing your best camera. Highly recommended if you are in the area!!! ',\n",
       " ' Lovely If you d like a real life behind the scenes glimpse of the royal palace s gardens  I highly recommend purchasing a ticket for the Huwon Tour  5000 won for an adult . However  you must first purchase an entry ticket for Changdeokgung itself. I was late to the free Changdeokgung tour  so after buying my Changdeokgung Huwon tour tickets  I quickly looked at the palaces in Changdeokgung and then hurried over to star the Huwon tour. Very lovely and well maintained  and it s fun seeing that even back then  the royals appreciated nature and art.',\n",
       " ' it was ok The palace complex was not too big compare to gyeongbokgung. There are too type of entrance. The palace entrance fee didnt include the garden entrance fee  we have to pay additional fee to enter the garden. The throne room was kinda similar with one in gyeongbokgung  but the inner quarter of the king design with western probably victorian style. The complex mostly redecorated during the reign of the last king of joseon...it was easy to reach...the anguk station was 200 meter from the changdeokgung They also offered a bundle ticket for this palace together with 2 other palace  gyeongbokgung and 1 other palace  i forgot  for 10.000W',\n",
       " ' Typical palace Palace was a nice structure with peaceful grounds. Not exactly ancient but does show the character and shows the pan Asian fertilization',\n",
       " ' Immense and Inspiring It sits on several acres and contains over 11o buildings. I was blessed enough to get the free English tour. A MUST SEE.',\n",
       " ' Cheap visit to the Palace We visited this Palace first and glad we did so as Gyeongbokgung Palace is more impressive. Entrance fee is 3000 won and does not include entry into the secret garden. However as we did not want a guided tour for 90 minutes we didn t pay for this. There is a Palace bundle for 10 000 won if you were looking to go to Gyeongbokgung and 2 other palaces. Entry is free for those in traditional Korean outfits and it was nice to see so many dressed in these outfits. The Palace was rebuilt so it looks in good condition and modernish. It is a good place to while away an hour or two and get an idea of the history at a very cheap price. ',\n",
       " ' Great palace This palace is great and less tourist packed than Gyeongbokgung Palace. Should be visited along with Gyeongbokgung and Bukchok Hanok village sinse they are all close to each other If you really are someone who likes to walk I would recommend the following route. Start from Gwanghwamun station  or City hall station and pass Gwanghwamun gate    Gwanghwamun Square  Gwanghwamun Gate   Gyeongbokgung Palace  The folk museum of korea   Bukchok Hanok village   Changdeokgung Palace   Insadong   Cheonggyecheon Stream   Gwanghwamun station.',\n",
       " ' Good choice to visit I didn t pay the entrance fee 3000 KRW  korean won  because it s free on Wednesday of the last week of the months. All palaces are free except the secret garden  5000 KRW  that is behind the changdeokgung. It takes around hour to finish the tour of the palace. ',\n",
       " ' Royal residential villa from the Joseon period Well preserved and in good balance with nature and city  you should visit it. Take care to not come when schools are present.',\n",
       " ' Another beautiful building We saw the changing of the guard which was a lovely sight we also got to dress up in national costume and have our photos taken with the guards.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful We arrived at 9am to ensure we had a place on the 2.30pm Secret Garden Tour  only 50 places per tour available on the day . We then spent the morning at Bukchon Village which is an easy walk away and definitely worth the visit. Palace and Gardens were beautiful and the Garden Tour was a welcome relief from the afternoon sun as it is mostly shaded. Our tour guide was very informative and spoke excellent English. Definitely a must when visiting Seoul.',\n",
       " ' The best well preserved Palace in Seoul! Very beautiful palace with a secret garden separate ticket needed  giuded tour only with freindly giudes who speak English fluently . A good souvenir shop with refreshments and rest rooms. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace This is a beautiful palace  very easy to visit if you are in the insa dong bukchon area. It closes at 5pm  I believe  so make sure to check hours before visiting. There s many places around the palacs that will rent you traditional Korean clothing  hanbok  which makes for a fun and memorable photo opportunities! ',\n",
       " ' Best 5 hours on a lay over...incheon airport Yes  join the city tour for free! Add 10.00 and you get a traditional korean lunch. The palace itself is huge  some stairs  not handicapped accessible. Interesting history of an ancient culture. I wish they have some handouts in different languages since some of the tour guides doesn t speak fluent English. ',\n",
       " ' Do the tour of the palace  secret garden tour a bit of a disappointment We did the 90 min Secret Garden tour as the website stated that it was required in order to enter. When we arrived  we were informed that they now have an option of walking around on your own. We love to learn about what we are looking at so opted to stay with the tour  as did about 70 other people. The guide was in a hurry to cover everything and began commentary before half of the large group had caught up to each location. So it became frustrating to have to run to the front of the group in order to hear the guide. It might ve been more pleasurable to avoid this and just amble around on our own. The palace was impressive. Unfortunately  our small group was not interested in any other tour after the Secret Garden. So  if I had a do over  I would skip the secret garden tour and go for the palace tour. And I would rent one of the traditional dresses from nearby Bukchon to enter for free. Of the two palaces  I like Gyeongbokung better.',\n",
       " ' place and garden The palace is nice  but the gardens are outstanding. If you have a chance to tour both  allow for extra time. The opening hours for palace and garden are different. ',\n",
       " ' Free tour was great We attended the 10.30am free English guided tour and it was very informative. We then went to the 11.30 Secret Garden tour   good but we abandonded half way through to make another engagement   beautiful gardens.',\n",

       " ' The Enchanting Huwon Changdeokgung seems like a smaller version of Gyeongbokgung. As a secondary palace  it pales in comparison to the grandeur and majesty of Gyeongbokgung. However  what sets it apart from the main palace complex is that enclosed in it is Huwon or The Secret Garden. For me  that gives you enough reason to add this to your must see attractions. Don t miss out on the guided tour specifically meant for Huwon. It s quite lengthy at 90 minutes and involves some trekking but the captivating serenity of this garden  and hearing anecdotes about the Korean monarchs who frequent the garden would make it worth the trouble!',\n",
       " ' Nice architecture    I really like the architecture of these ancient palaces. Another thing that might be nice to see is the change of the guards. Always a nice show of itself.',\n",
       " ' Busy but amazing Definitely worth visiting if you are in Seoul. The architecture is amazing and there are lots of things to see  so make sure you have some time up your sleeves to really wander around and see everything you can. There are a lot of people visiting too though so I suggest going early in the morning or in the late afternoon.',\n",

       " ' Time your visit right to make the most of this attraction You need to arrive fairly early if you want to do the secret garden tour after the palace tour. English speaking guides take the tour around the palace at 10.30am and the secret garden tour kicks off at 11.30am. We turned up a bit late so although we had the palace tour  the garden tour was sold out and we had to wait until 1.30pm for that. Luckily our hotel was very near so we nipped back there as there isn t really another two hours of activity once you have toured the palace. The talk was very good at giving an insight into court life  meaning when we later went to Gyeongbokgung Palace we didn t feel it necessary to join a guided tour. Word of warning to the infirm  the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense  especially in the heat. It s also worth buying the four palace pass if you intend to visit all the palaces in Seoul. We only did these two  but I d recommend them both. Gyeongbokgung is much bigger and also contains two fantastic museums. A real must visit.',\n",
       " ' Another Must Visit Place There are a few palaces in Seoul. This palace is near some other places of interest such as Bukchon village and Insadong. So  why would we skip this when we were also visiting other attractions nearby?',\n",
       " ' Don t Miss the Secret Garden The real attraction of Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden. The palace itself was not as fascinating to us as Gyeongbokgung or Deoksugung which had costumed actors on site and changing of the guard pageantry. We visited Changdeokgung on a Sunday morning. No performers were in costume  although quite a few locals visiting were in colorful traditional Korean attire. An English speaking guide took us on a tour of the buildings which were interesting  but the Secret Garden tour was the real attraction. It s best to make reservations at least 24 hours in advance for the Secret Garden tour. We managed to see the palace grounds at 10 30am  followed immediately by the garden tour at 11 30am. The walled garden is beautifully landscaped with water features  trees  flowers  and Korean style buildings and pagodas. The royal family spent their leisure time here  so every aspect of the garden is well planned. The first 45 minutes of the walk is easy  the second half apparently  more athletic  we were told by the guide  so we decided to take it easy at go back at the halfway point. Cost is 3 000 KRW for the palace and 5 000 KRW for the garden.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace in Seoul My first time to visit Korea s palace and it was amazing. We took a lot of pictures at the entrance as there was some men who wearing the tradition Korean customs. It was a pity that we didn t spend much time at the palace and wish to try the Korean customs. We also didn t have time to visit the secret garden. For me  I will visit this palace next time.',\n",

       " ' Beautiful palace Different to Gyeongbukgung Palace  in that the architecture seems less grand and imposing  but still worth visiting for its beautiful grounds. The gardens within the grounds are lush and beautiful and I would recommend buying the inexpensive guide book from the front gate if you can t make the tour times. ',\n",
       " ' World Heritage of Joseon Dynasty Changdeokgung Palace is located not far away from both Anguk station and Jongnosam ga metro staion. It is 15 minutes walk. The palace is vast and has 2 sections  the Main Palace and the Secret Garden. Both have its entrance fee. Visiting this world heritage complex needs 2 hours walk around. It is a beautiful place to visit.',\n",

Join the garden tour  the story and explanation is interesting and meaningful to learn about Korea s culture and history. The garden area is big  everywhere is pretty scenic and serene  surrounded by greens. The atmosphere is just lovely  I bet it would be beautiful during autumn with the fall colors. The tour goes through some slopes and hills  so be sure to wear comfortable shoes for walking. Tour guide was really friendly and is willing to answer all our questions. After the secret garden tour  we visited some other buildings in the palace  there are very similar with other palace  so nothing new for us.',\n",
       " ' An impressive palace My fiance and I visited this palace on a Sunday afternoon. The sheer size of the palace is quite impressive and it is well worth the 3 000 won entrance fee. We also wanted to experience the secret garden  however access to the garden is restricted to guided tours only  and the tour time table did not fit with our time schedule. Opening hours  palace and secret garden  is from 09 00. Closing time varies between 16 30 to 18 00 depending on the time of year. Closed on Mondays. Guided tours  in English  to the secret garden is at  11 30 13 30 14 30 15 30 English speaking guided tours are offered only between February and October.

There are lots to see and sometime if you are lucky enough  you will see some special performance. The palace include a lot of painting and there is also a library inside the palace. The presentient working office is just right behind the Palace. Many people there when this is a nice weather. Be sure to check out TravoAsia.com first  they also have apps. as they are specialize in Korea attraction ticket and may provide you with surprise discount. I have bought some attraction ticket from them and it was good. For transportation  you can reach the palace by subway  although you have take about 10 min walk from there. have a good day. ',\n",

       " ' Beautiful Palace We visited Changdeokgung Palace after a visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace in the morning. They are very different and unique in their own way. I personally prefer the Changedeokgung more due to the Secret Garden. You can only visit the secret garden by joining the guided tour. I would recommend that you book the ticket via its website in advance to avoid disappointment. It s an hour and a half tour and it s a pity that one is not allowed to stay and explore more after the tour. ',\n",
       " ' Best palace The secret gardens make this tour worth it. Even though it is ranked higher  we thought this palace was better than Gyeongbukgung Palace. The tour was 1.5 hours and I thought I would get bored  not a chance. Every 5 mins we were on to a different area with a new story. It was amazing. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace grounds I went in July which was very warm and humid so if you are going at this time make sure you have plenty of water and sun protection. The visit would have been nicer if the weather was cooler. The entrance fee is 3000 but I would advise you to get the Secret Garden tour which includes the entrance fee at 8000. For a 1.5 hour tour they bring you further inside and you get to see more. The palace is peaceful and beautiful but I was a little underwhelmed. Asked a friend who went to Gyeongbokgung palace  she says it is grander than this palace so wished I gone to that one instead.',\n",

       " ' Pick this if you don t want to visit them all If you will visit only one palace  I recommend this one. This palace is smaller than the main palace but still quite large. The palace has a  Secret garden  but note that you will have to purchase a separate ticket for that because you may only visit in a group. Perfect for a hot day because in the garden the trees will make a cooling shadow over the paths. The place is very quiet even though it is almost in the heart of Seoul. They sell water in the garden tour with a reasonable price.',\n",

       " ' The secret garden is gorgeous An occupied palace fir over 600 years with amazing grounds. The maintenance must be huge but this place is kept in good condition despite the small admission fee. The English secret garden tour at 130pm was great. It s up and over a couple of hills but you see some tranquil and beautiful sights on this tour. Allow a good couple of hours to do it justice. ',\n",

       " ' to understand korean history This one of the must do in terms of Korean tourist sites. It had vast and big grounds and a lot of palace buildings yet had an eerie tranquil feeling about it. The buildings seemed to be constantly destroyed and rebuilt   which is a bit like the psychic of the Korean history   forever under attack. It is an interesting way to learn the history of Korea and how hard it must have been. The grounds were really big so it was an impressive show   well spent the afternoon meandering around. A lot of the Koreans were also walking around taking photos in their traditional outfits as one gets free entrance wearing the traditional Hancock.',\n",

Both guides did a good job explaining the palace and the garden.',\n",

I have been here twice and it is beautiful. I recommend doing both tours if you have time. I was reluctant to do the palace tour  on my 9th palace visit  but really enjoyed it. The guide focuses on telling you what happened in each building and how they were used as well as fun little stories about the people who lived there. It was a tour unique to this place and moved at a good speed. The garden tour really depends on the guide. My first time he was fantastic and gave funny stories about each place and the second he let us wander alone a bit more. No matter what you must do the tour to see the garden  which is really the whole point of this place. Strongly recommend   if you only see 1 palace other than Gyeongbukgung this should be it.',\n",

It was the site of the royal court and the seat of government until 1868. Korea s last Emperor Sunjong  lived here until his death in 1926. Currently  only about 30  of the pre Japanese structures survive and consist of 13 buildings remaining on the palace grounds and 28 pavilions in the gardens  occupying 110 acres. This palace is extremely beautiful and well kept. It is a pleasure to see how Koreans have gone to great length to preserve their history.',\n",

Exquisitely landscaped garden  quite a bit of up and down walking but plenty of opportunities to sit and reflect. So peaceful in the bustling heart of the city. Definitely one of my favourite places in Seoul and I would definitely go again.',\n",

       " ' Second best A must see. Personally  I prefer the Gyeongbokgung Palace but maybe you need to see both to appreciate the subtle differences. A stroll through the complex takes around 30min on your own  the guided tours last 1hr but as we had kids  we lasted only about 10minutes before backing out. I d recommend to book for the Secret Garden tour online to guarantee your spot as it can get very busy and you might not get in on your preferred times. The secret garden tour lasts 1.5hrs and is perfectly doable even with small kids. If you have a stroller or a scooter  bring it with you. There is no refreshments throughout the whole complex  so stock up on something to nibble on. A water bottle is a must too. Allow roughly 2 3hrs to visit.',\n",

I heard there are limited people allowed to go in the secret garden at one time  so what we did is reserve the slot online.

To join huwon secret garden tour  head to the secret garden counter to buy the tickets separately for a set tour time. the tour is availabe in english  korean  japanese and chinese. normally  you can only go in with a tour. But this time they allowed visitors to roam away from the tour group giving more time and privacy to take selfies without the crowd in the background. Changdeokgung palace itself was pretty impressive especially if u watch a lot of period K Dramas. More impressive than Gyeongbokgung palace in my opinion. If you re planning to visit all the palaces and huwon secret garden tour  do get the combination passes for only 10 000won. More value in my opinion. ',\n",

The palace itself is cozy and not exhausting  interesting to see the layout  but the secret garden is the major attraction here  so please make sure you visit it! It s spread on a relatively wide surface but the alleys are very pleasant and it conveys peace and calm  it s a definite must. You hand to join a tour in order to be able to enter  at specific hours  and it takes about 1.5h but it s totally worth it and the guide was very gifted to transport us in the mood and the stories of the time.

       " ' A must see as one of the first things to do in Seoul I d recommend this as your first stop in Seoul to get a feel for what Korea has to offer. It will most likely also be all the palaces and temples you will want to see for your whole time in Seoul  which is fair because there s so much more to do in the city. Maybe my expectations were too high  but while I found it was nice to walk around and experience something I don t normally see which is of high historic value  I found it a little underwhelming. Although for such a low price it s definitely worth it. You re free to walk around by yourself without a tour  plenty of opportunities to take photos  the tour isn t really essential unless you want to learn a lot about the history. The Secret Garden tour is reasonably good and gives you enough information about the palace to keep you satisfied. Even then  you re not really missing out if you don t take a tour  but it s still nice to do. Jongmyo is the only place in the area where you ve forced to take a tour 6 days of the week  so if you have limited time I d recommend not taking any tours here.',\n",

       " ' Great Historical Introduction to Korea A friend and I took the Secret Garden Tour  1.5 hour tour  and it provided a satisfactory perspective of Korea s history   from its early beginnings to today. Our guide spoke very easy to understand English and used an amplifier so that everyone could hear her. I was amazed to see her wearing a traditional hanbok in the heat and humidity! The gardens are very beautiful  feature several water fixtures  and wind through a seemingly endless supply of architecturally beautiful pavilions. It does not feel like you are in the middle of a busy city with all the green trees providing shade overhead. With that said  the tour can still be a little tiring. There are numerous hills and you will walk a fair distance. I would recommend bringing water and insect repellent. There is a cafe at the entrance to the palace and a souvenir shop near the large pond in the Secret Garden Tour. You will find different souvenirs at each so if you see something you like  buy it  as it may not be at the other shops. I purchased a collection of Korean stamps! There were some neat looking trees on the property   one that is believed to be at least 700 years old! There were lots of photo opportunities and the tour guide was good a maintaining a good pace   not too rushed! Recommend if you want to see a palace.',\n",

The reason for the second time was because I was not able to catch the Secret Garden tour and I was with a different set of friends the second time i went I m not sure how this palace is compared to the other palaces but i t definitely good for picture taking and it s near the bukchon hanok village  D The first time you arrive here you ll be thrilled by the giant ark at the front. I am not sure how long we spent just to get a perfect picture there. When you go inside  the doors and the koreanovela feels will hit you! if you are a fan  D . After a while it will feel kind of boring as the palace is very big haha and i m sure you ll feel tired! But despite this i would definitely recommend this place and the huwon tour i would recommend on autumn or spring because the trees are dry when we got there. After this you can go straight to bukchon hanok for more of the koreanovela feel.  D',\n",

The secret gardens are well worth the extra ticket. Visitors are allowed in small groups of about 50 people at a time. In the Secret Garden  Beewon  you can see magnificent ponds  smaller intimate scale buildings made for the royal family and unusual sets of buildings intended for the royals to  experience  a rustic village. The area for poetry writing and drinking is well preserved.',\n",

It was a 5 mins walk and hard to get out of bed with the cold weather. But I am glad I did it. This is my 3rd palace for the week. And though I missed the glorious autumn leaves  I was rewarded at Deoksugung   this palace is not a UNESCO heritage site for nothing. It is the grandest of the 3 palaces I visited  the other being Gyeonbokgung  and it suitably named as a palace. The Korean Tourist Office has done a wonderful job managing my expectations that it is not as grand as China s. This palace has the history and grandeur. Our guide was the best guide of all the tours I had. She speaks English with an American accent and it was easy to understand her. As my tour ends at 11 25pm  I rushed to the Secret Garden s English Tour which starts at 11 30am. Trust me  it was super freezing and I was having second thoughts. Especially when our guide was warning as of the long walk and steps. Then I looked around. There are folks with strollers! I have to press on !! One third through the tour  at this beautiful part with the pond and the pavilion is.......it started to snow !! Magical !! And the snow got heavier and heavier. I d never forget this special moment! The last time I experienced this  it was in Nikko Japan  and that was about 10 years ago! So it you are only in Seoul for a short time  and have to choose ONE to go.....this is the one. It was too cold for me to linger around after the cold. So I hurried back to get my umbrella and to watch to snow falling out of my window before catching authentic lunch at a hanok. If you are in the area  end your tour with lunch at Gung Hanjeogsik. You need to cross the right traffic light  coming out from main entrance. Walk straight down the first road  then turn left. It s not easy to find  but worth it! I have come to realised  this trip  that having many reviews in TA on a particular restaurant is not necessarily the best. It could have been overly commercialised. It s super! And if you want stretch your visit to this area more  visit the',\n",

The palace is humongous so be prepared for a very long walk. Also note there really isn t much food you can purchase within the palace itself except for some drinks  so be prepared for that as well. The palace does get a bit repetitive at times  although the nicely manicured grounds do make up for it.',\n",

The guide was able to relate what takes place in the different buildings and pavilions and makes one feel that they were part of the ceremonies. The palace is open 9 00 to 18 00 but during winter only up to 17 30. It is also closed on Mondays. Adults pay Won3 000 or a little below  3 and children pay W1 500 . if traveling on your own  you can take the subway or the Bus and join the scheduled tours by the park like English is 10 30 and 14 30... The palace is preserved and restored even after it was destroyed during the Japanese invasion  1592 1598  and after that was used by the monarchy for 270 years. This was preserved until this date for tourism purposes.',\n",

       " ' Fun visit This property was a good tour. They have several English speaking guides and tours throughout the day. The guide was knowledgeable and I recommend you take this tour as the guide had a few free tips that were of interest. The tour finished in 50 minute and finished just outside the entrance to the secret garden. We didn t have enough time to fit in the secret garden on this trip  but not because of the tour length as it ended near the secret garden about 10 minutes prior to that for starting. ',\n",
       " ' Interesting The palace grounds were expansive and the trees and leaves on the grounds were coloured beautifully in shades of red yellows and orange in Early december. We have signed up for the secret garden tour which proved was great as the guide was very informative on the history and description of the area. The gardens were also equally beautiful with the historical buildings and a backdrop of autumnal flora and fauna. This would definitely be on my must visit list for Seoul. I would advise visitors to look up secret garden tour timings in their language prior to their visit as you can only enter the secret garden as part of a guided tour group. The grounds and garden are filled with plenty of steep steps and slopes   would advise those with walking difficulty to give this a pass as it would be hard to move around. There is only a small shop beside the gift shop offereing coffee and light refreshments   visitors would definitely have to head elsewhere for food.',\n",
       " ' Insights into history Great location to gain insights into the history of Korea. Need a good guide to introduce the area and bring history to life.',\n",
       " ' Great place to spend a couple of hours Interesting palace  and different from the others in the vicinity. As we entered two volunteers offered to give us an English guided tour  which was really interesting. We didn t get to see the secret garden unfortunately   an excuse to go back!',\n",
       " ' Impressive Palace Grounds Very impressive palace grounds. Have visited in two separate trips. Very expansive. Only issue was long ticket lines on Sunday.',\n",
       " ' Walk in Balmy Spring Night This palace is open at night for certain period of the year. It used to be at the center of heavy and noisy traffic with a zoo. Now it is relatively quieter neighborhood. Without a zoo. One amazing development is all the walkways are accessible to wheelchairs. It opens at 7 at night. As it is less popular than another palace in downtown  it is less hubbub. You can enjoy a great walk feeling the spring air. No street vendors. Only some security guards as guiders. It was always there  you can find. I hope more spaces would be open and it would be connected to Secret Garden and Royal Family Garden. It would be then two hour walk. As of now  it was about 30 minutes walk. ',\n",
       " ' Walking aground a gem It is a great place to just walk around like 1 2 hours was enough for me. Also you can go to the other palace next to it where the elder leaders residence was. ',\n",
       " ' Must visit to history lover. Any one who s loves history. Specially the eastern history. They should come to this place I recommend it when weather is nice. There s a lot of walking the place is huge. So be carful. And make 6 hours to this amazing field. ',\n",
       " ' Palace in the middle of the town Easily access by subway   Angguk station  exit 3 . Entrance fee was 3k won and secret garden was 5k won. Closed on Monday. You can see many locals and tourist wore hanbok. Worth to come. ',\n",
       " ' Changing of the Guard At 10am promptly every morning you can watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Colorful  and not too crowded  we thoroughly enjoyed the pomp and ceremony. Lots of youngsters wearing national costume to the event   apparently you can rent them nearby for a couple of hours for a small fee and entry to the Palace will then be free   and lots of buses dropping off groups of school children. Well worth a visit.',\n",
       " ' Incredible palace complex. This vast palace complex is packed with beautiful buildings that would be massive draws by themselves in any other city in the world. The concentration of stunning architecture  huge courtyards and beautiful gardens is just wonderful. There are larger single temples in many places but here it s on an incredible scale I ve not seen before. And it costs less than 2.50 to visit! Also  I went on a Monday afternoon and saw a military parade in traditional dress too  which was great.',\n",
       " ' Strongly recommended Almost gave this place a miss. Am glad I didn t. Enjoy the experience  in particular the morning guard changing session which was an eye opener for me. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Gardens The palace is lovely  but the gardens are the real attraction. You do have to buy an extra ticket to view the gardens but it s inexpensive. Once inside wander the paths and you ll find the various gardens  each with their own charm. There are some nice places to sit and take everything on as well. ',\n",
       " ' Fascinating be sure to do the secret garden    there are regular tours in English. All signs are in Korean  English  Chinese  and Japanese.',\n",
       " ' Peaceful place in the city This is a beautiful palace that you are free to explore at your own pace for just  1. The buildings are well maintained and there are several styles to see. Don t miss the concubines area to enjoy some different designs. I couldn t get into see the secret garden as a tour needs to be booked  It takes more than an hour to see it . Even without the garden  it was a lovely place to stroll. We spend an hour or so  and it was enough time. Theres a small coffee shop gift shop which is a great place to get a drink  we had ginger ice tea and loved it  and then sit inside or out and just enjoy this peaceful place.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful garden We visit this palace on October. It was very beautiful  but they say it will be 100 times better in the fall  late October to November  when all the leaves turn to yellow. Prepare to walk a lot as this place is very big',\n",
       " ' Beautiful secret garden tour The secret garden tour of the palace is exceptionally popular during the Autumn season  so don t forget to make a reservation in advance!',\n",
       " ' It is another must! Great architecture of traditional Korean buildings  give you an idea of how they lived in past times. Very fascinating and educative. Loads of cute girls around visiting  wearing traditional Korean dresses. It is another must  in order to appreciate the local culture. You haven t been to Seoul if you don t visit it! ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Palace and Gardens Well preserved and the main draw is the beautiful  secret garden  where the Royal family members go to to relax and entertain. The ponds  pavilions and trees come out beautifully in photos. If you intend to visit more than one Palace it is best to buy the Combination Ticket of 10 000 won as the fee to enter Changdeokgung is 3 000 won and another 5 000 for entry into the secret garden.',\n",
       " ' love the secret garden walk make sure you do the secret garden walk! we had a wonderful time! a bit hilly but we managed a buggy fine',\n",
       " ' Excellent historical palace Changdeokgung is a popular tourist spot. Its Secret Garden is hotly sought after in autumn  booking of entry for the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung is via internet  6 days in advance  and all the places will be taken up within an hour or so  booking starting at 10 00 local time . Changdeokgung itself is quite typical but the Secret Garden looks more ancient and has retained much of the original character  despite the re built . It is a delight to visit the Secret Garden to experience the absolute tranquility and beauty of an ancient garden.',\n",
       " ' Temples One if the main ancient temples in Seoul. Very cheap entrance fee. Good location in Seoul  not far from other temples.',\n",
       " ' Majestic Palace. This palace is not as big as the other one in Seoul but is as nice or better. Walk in to the palace and its grounds with a nice lake  it also hosts a nice museum.',\n",
       " ' Good learning place All the buildings are conserved and maintained very well. It s a really good place for those who want to learn about Korean history. There were groups of school kids maybe on school trip.',\n",
       " ' Scenery is good Maybe  there is no fun if there is no interest in Korean films. I do not know whether there is worth a look to pay money. Chinese and does Mase Japanese city council.',\n",
       " ' Just a park with some pavilions Was expecting more I guess  but the Secret garden is really just a park  not much of a garden. Didn t find it worth the time.',\n",
       " ' Not so Secret Garden As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction  such as the Secret Garden here  and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference bearing in mind that numbers can be limited The buildings in the main palace area are impressive in their size and magnificence   highly restored and in some cases I guess recreations The entrance ticket does not allow access to the Secret Garden a separate timed ticket has to be obtained  and can be pre booked online . You pick a time that coincides with your preferred language  numbers are limited to 30 per tour  Luckily you do not have to stick with the tour guide   but can wander off and look around the garden independently. It covers an immense area and is hilly in parts. Even with a limit on numbers it does get very crowded   especially with noisy school parties   so not such a  secret !! Everything was well maintained with some of the areas being restored. Throughout the site visitor amenities are excellent',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Architecture Stunning palace and very ornate. It is walking distance between two other palaces and the area is easily accessible by metro train.',\n",
       " ' Serene and Beautiful I visited on a Wednesday. Contrary to the information in some other reviews  there are many secret garden tours available  including 4 per day in English  this depends on the time of year  see the palace website for full details . Currently  the tours take 200 people instead of the palace website stated 100  this may have been due to Chinese National Day. 50 tickets can be booked ahead and the rest are claimed at the palace. I was able to purchase tickets at 11 15 for the 11 30 tour. As for the palace itself  very nice and the layout is very different from palaces I ve seen before. While some of the layout is perpendicular building and walkway placement  much of it is off at odd angles to meld seamlessly with the natural terrain. This was a nice contrast to the forbidden city in Beijing. The garden tour is definitely worth the time  90 minutes . The tour guide has some useful information and the tour group quickly dwindles to a reasonable size  but you re free to leave the tour guide from the start if you like to do your own thing.',\n",
       " ' Visit the secret garden! The exterior is not as spacious and grand as Gueongbokgung. However  it s a prettier palace with more trees and a mysterious feel. Go visit the secret garden for a stroll  5000Won per entry  We had a great time enjoying the scenery and breeze inside. There are slopes and much steps at the end of the walk and not suitable for person with walking inconvenience.',\n",
       " ' Nice The palace is actually a complex of buildings which is very nice to visit. Inside there is an additional palace for which an extra ticket is required. I had not planned to visit it and indeed did not. Inside there is also the Secret Garden  also additional ticket. I took it and was not impressed. Would recommend to skip.',\n",
       " ' Nice buildings It s 3 000W to get in then another 5 000W for the secret garden tour. A nice bunch of buildings but to be honest A LOT of it is inaccessible  you can only look from the outside   there isn t too much in between  the grounds feel sparse   and of course so little of it is original. A huge number of people come here each day so I wouldn t call it peaceful but an ok place to visit if it s the only palace you go to while in Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Excellent tour in the secret garden. Went to the secret garden tour. Must visit when you go to this place. Lot of walking involved. Wear comfortable footwear.',\n",
       " ' Nice palace The palace is a great place to see Korean history. There is a changing of the guard that is a must see. Don t know if they are there all the time but there were kids dressed in traditional clothes. Fun to take pics with. There is an entrance fee into the back of the grounds. Did not have the time so did not go in further. A must see! ',\n",
       " ' The Secret Garden is a must see! Beautiful palace and so many stories to unfold. Rated the most beautiful palace out of the 5 grand palace. ',\n",
       " ' Tours Make The Experience Pros  UNESCO world heritage site  beautiful architecture and grounds  free tours in multiple languages Cons  Can be crowded  especially with school groups   historical perspective is missed without the tour guide explanations  lots of walking. I visited the palace on an afternoon in October  the weather was perfect for a few hours outside. Although there were quite a few school groups there  I didn t have to wait to take the tours in English. I purchased the combined ticket  palace and a secret garden  for 8 000 won   a bargain in my opinion. The architecture was really neat  from the designs and colors to the building sizes and concepts. The tour guides did a great job of explaining the little details that you might overlook  for example  I would never have guessed that the larger doorways were only for the emperor  while the smaller doorways were for the government officials and others   using those smaller doorways required the individuals to  bow  as the entered. Personally  while I enjoyed the palace grounds  I liked the secret garden better  but this was due in part to the excellent tour guide and her details on how it was used by the emperors. The explanations and history changed the experience  bringing the buildings to life as one considers what it must have been like in the garden hundreds of years ago. I did note that the tour moves at a fairly set pace  and it is better if you focus on staying with the guide so you can see and hear her details   you can always walk back through areas at your own pace then the tour is over.

       " ' Nice place to see the guards exchanging shift A nice place which you should go visit one for taking pictures. Also interesting to see the guards changing shift',\n",
       " ' Giant palace with a hidden lotus pond We visited Changdeokgung palace on a Sunday around 10am and the crowds have fully yet to arrive. A great time to be there since there is very little shade to beat the heat or cover you from the rain. There are several palaces as you continue to walk inside. There is a small fee to get inside but you will be greeted with a relaxing lotus pond towards the end of the palace. ',\n",
       " ' Absolutely stunning Different from Gyeongbokgung with the layout of the buildings done in such a way as to blend with the topography  this is a beautiful place. I visited both here and Gyeongbokgung and if you have time for only one of the two  this is the one. Excellent free tours in English. Entrance is a frankly ridiculous 3000 won  and a small guide book at 500 won can surely hardly cover the printing cost. Plan your visit to make sure that you get the tour of the Huwon secret gardens. Twice the size of the palace area  these are just stunning but can only be visited as part of a tour  with numbers limited  and costs a further 5000 won  buy both tickets at the same time . Be aware that there is walking involved  not all of it flat  and the tour takes a little time. The palace tour will finish in time for the Huwon tour  and close to where it starts. I got the 10.30 palace tour and the 11.30 Huwon tour and was finished at 13.00. ',\n",
       " ' Really good experience for 3 hours A must see place. Built of 3 major attractions  2 Palaces and 1 secret garden. You will pay 9 000 won to gain entry to all 3 and it s worth it. Have fun.',\n",
       " ' Exploring SEOUL We went to Seoul in June  it was quite hot  I had high expectations about Seoul but so far it was just an average trip that didn t have much attraction. We went to Changdeokgung Palace. I like places with history and story attached to it. I enjoyed the food but didn t love it. I guess enjoying loving your travel will depend on the places that you go. So maybe next time I will try the outskirts of Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Quiet and pretty If visiting the Secret Garden  it is quieter and less crowded than Gyeongbukgong because you must book a tour to enter. In my opinion  this is a top site to visit in Seoul. The garden is small but pretty and tranquil. It does not compare at all in terms of splendor or grandeur to the imperial gardens of China  but does have its own unique flavor. It is clean and well preserved. If you can  plan to spend a bit of time relaxing there. There are a number of small pavilions set up with books there to chill. A very nice touch. wear your hanbok for free admission. ',\n",
       " ' Simpler Palace Part of the tour was a visit to Changdeokung Palace. Its design is not as detailed and intricate as that of Gyeongbokgung. It is much simpler and there were few people who visited this palace. Considered as Changdeokgung Palace was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee.',\n",
       " ' A nice escape inside the city For me  visiting Seoul has been a lot of hustle and bustle. The Palace and Gardens were still very busy but visiting provided a but of respite from the crowds of Insadong. Changdeokgung is one of four palaces  plus a shrine  in the area but is the only one that has a separate tour of the gardens. The secret garden area is by tour only  large groups limited to 100 per tour  and they have different times with different languages. For entrance plus the garden tour it is 8000 won  but for only 10 000 won you can get a palace pass to visit the other 4 locations within 3 months of purchase. Definitely get the pass! The other four locations included are Gyeonbokgung palace  Changgyeonggung palace  Deoksung Palace and the Jongmyo Shrine. My husband and I went on an afternoon English tour on a Saturday afternoon. The guide provided insight into how the royal family lived and used each of the buildings within the garden area and spoke english very clearly. The fall foliage makes it an excellent time to visit the gardens with a wide variety of trees changing. I believe the tour lasts about an hour and a half and does have steep hills to walk up. Other than the garden tour  the palace is mostly just open space. The buildings themselves are beautiful and historically interesting  but there isn t a whole lot going on other than the buildings themselves. You will likely see many visitors dressed up in traditional Korean Hanbok taking photos within the palace. If you d like  any places in the area rent these  I know I saw a few in the Insadong market  My favorite thing about visiting the palaces is that they are literally right in the middle of the city. The city grew around the palaces so it is an interesting juxtaposition of the old and new. Definitely worth a visit  if you have to choose just one palace I d pick Changdeokgung. By Metro get off at Anguk Station and follow exit signs for  Changdeokgung Palace  When you exit  continue straight a few blocks and you ll walk right into it on your left.',\n",
       " ' Big Palace with the Secret Garden Changdeokgung Palace popular with the Secret Garden tour. the palace looks similar to palaces in Gyeongbokgung Palace. but the Secret Garden is a different view. to enter the garden  you need to follow the tour  held with the schedule. just come at the ticket booth of Changdeokgung  and see the schedule there. it have tour guide in English. really good!',\n",
       " ' A visit to the back up palace According to UNESCO  this biwon or secret garden situated within changdeokgung is a treasure because the landscaping is a natural occurrence. The park is built to preserve the natural landscaping in this enclosed area. According to the tour guide  the palace is a smaller place built strategically for emergency purposes. In case of plague  war  fire or any disaster  Changdeokgung is a backup. ',\n",
       " ' Most of the popular tourist attractions are fairly well serviced by public transport. Interesting  and one needs some time to plan out your journey to these tourist attraction spots. But then  one must prepare to do some walking on foot. Mindful of the day of the week that some of these places may be closed to visitors. ',\n",
       " ' Best palace in Seoul One of the 5 big palaces in Seoul. For me the best one. Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces  5    10 000 W and try the guided tour. Its free  all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see. There are separate tours for palace and the secret garden. There are separate tickets for palace and secret garden  unless you buy combined ticket   then you have it all in one .',\n",
       " ' One Massive Palace! This place is massive. You can spend the whole day in this beautiful palace. Secret Garden and an inner attraction of the compound however needs additional charges payments aside from the entrance fee. Bring a camera because this place is one beautiful site of Seoul  South Korea.',\n",
       " ' Historical It s a great place and it s well preserved. It remains intact and is situated in front of the Blue House  and behind the statue of King Sejong. If you want to know more about South Korea s history  this is the way to go. It only took us a 3 5 min. Walk from our guesthouse   Guesthouse Korea . There was a performance for like every 20 mins or so? Where performers dress up as the way that people dressed before and did the rituals etc. To depict the old times. At the end of the ceremony  some performers stand outside the palace and station there where you can take a picture with them  Proper manners and gestures should be observed. They ll feel violated if you get touchy with them.  Inside  I can say that the overall palace is well maintained. The comfort rooms are also great. Once you get out  you will see the front of the Blue House  you can also take a stroll in the side walks to enjoy the streets of Korea while enjoying the views of the falling leaves of the tree s',\n",

It is called  Bi won  in Korean  and which means  Secret Garden  because this place was allowed to special persons only in Chosun Dynasty. English speaking guides are available. There are several time section and Koreans can t join English section without foreigners company. Secret Garden is available only visitors who reserve it in advance.',\n",

The palace is very big  well preserved. A lot of small garden  areas... if you can ask for the map it will be very helpful. The buildings  houses  temples  gates  halls... are quite impressive. Peaceful after all the tourists have left. I left the Secret Garden  separate ticket  til 1400  after I saw the palace. It was just me. But in the late afternoon when all the tourists went home  and a lot of locals  couples would be there in their traditional dress. Really enjoyable time  quite place to see the true tranquillity of the place. Ask the locals for photographs  they are more than welcome to let you do it and offer to take photo for them too   ',\n",

It has two parts palaces and garden. For the garden you require separate ticket   be careful and ask in advance in ticket office  you only can access garden like a part of free guided tour but you have to purchase ticket first and if you will stack in the queue you are risking to be late for the tour. Then you will not be able to enter till the next tour  which will be in 2 hours . There are also free guided tours for buildings parts   which is nice because otherwise you will be just looking on many empty buildings.',\n",

Changdeokgung is smaller and has more traditional housing. It is very similiar in terms of structure  the look etc... i liked the long walk towards the main palace  on the left  as many korean drama has that. If you re into korean history  then I would recommend to visit. If not  it probably won t be that interesting exciting.',\n",

Went on the garden tour which was muddy and not very interesting. The walking areas are sandy dirt  so plan accordingly as your shoes will be a mess when you leave. It had rained snowed a few days before my visit and the grounds were not in great shape. Worth going  but probably much nicer in spring and summer. I would not pay extra for the garden tour in the winter as there is not much to see.',\n",
       " ' Found this palace quite uplifting The setting is beautiful with the gardens and trees. The palace is set according to the topography and is focused on harmony. So it wa out of the norm. Winter is a good time to go and you may see many young people in traditional clothing on a Sunday. ',\n",
       " ' Nice in Spring time I had a lovely day out at Changdeokgung Palace. I got the palace combo ticket which allows entry into a few palaces in Seoul and a Shrine. So if you re wanting to visit a few I would recommend getting the combo. I think this attraction is best visited in Spring time because the gardens in the palace look beautiful during these months. It s also sunny  warm days and blue skies so probably the best time for a long walk around the palace and gardens. This palace has the secret gardens which are lovely. It s a great palace to visit for nice walks and good photos ops. ',\n",
       " ' try to catch the night tours for the secret garden by moonlight! i went a few times over the year to this place for the night tour which happens in the autumn and spring months. its affordable and maybe the prettiest by night of all the palaces.',\n",
       " ' Beauutiful palace and tranquil A must visit venue  English speaking guides   need to book in advance. Guided tour lasts about 1.5 hours  but you can spend lost more time there enjoying the history and the heritage. ',\n",
       " ' GO BACK IN TIME This was great. I am positive it would be prettier in the summer months with flowers etc. The young wear proper uniforms and dress to visit. The guards do something every day i think at 3pm',\n",
       " ' Little brother of the forbidden city? A small brother of the forbidden city in Bejing. The buildings are well preserved and it s a pleasure to wander around this complex of palaces. You will meet a lot of locals in authentic clothing!',\n",
       " ' Calm Palace I like this palace. There was a group of 15 tourists in the tour...guide was fine and eager to explain every details. God palace was huge and even with many tourists  one did not feel crowded. I loved the sights of many young Korean ladies dressed up their traditional attire to be photographed by friends...giggling and smiling...very nice. I recommend the place for a slow stroll!',\n",
       " ' Historical Palace Historical place. Accessible. Very colorful guard. Cool and quiet place to walk. Safe. Nice to see lots of students in traditional Korean costumes. ',\n",
       " ' Seeking for a quiet well known palace? This is the place. Changdeokgung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung  but this palace is more quiet in terms of tourist flow than Gyeongbokgung. If you come early on the morning  you hear the birds singing and hear the nice sound of the wind  so if you are a nature lover this is your spot. The entrance admission is 3000 KRW  3 USD   so it is the same as Gyeongbokgung. Overall  this is my favorite Korean palace  not only because it is a World Heritage  but because it has a good blend of being for tourists and locals. Also  the architecture is more trendy and the palace itself has a more clear path to look around. Good location  located around 5 minutes from the Anguk metro station. TIP  Closed on Mondays. It may get busy on Tuesdays  because Gyeongbokgung is closed on that day.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Smaller and less powerful presence than the main palace  but more beautiful and peaceful atmosphere. Once inside  hard to imagine one is in a large  modern city. Great contrast to the other palaces.',\n",
       " ' Nice venue This was my first Palace visit in Seoul. I bought the combined toicket for all palaces and the Secret Garden for 10 000 KRW. Had a guidded tour in English of the Palace  aprox. 45 minutes  and another tour of the Secret Garden  aprox. 1h30  . Tours are free  guides were very interesting  just be sure to be there for the English Tour  there are a couple a day only . The venue is not as crowded as Gyongbokgung Palace. ',\n",
       " ' Another lovely palace to visit. If you are staying in Seoul for a few days or weeks you are best buying the multi ticket for 5 of the palaces and entry to the secret garden. Again there are free guided tours that are well worth the money of the entrance fee. But be aware  if you have the multi ticket you still have to queue up to exchange the ticket you have for an entrance ticket. Like the other palaces a lot of the buildings are new representations of what used to be there but there are some original ones. The signs against all of the buildings explain their purposes well too. No food is allowed to be taken into Changdeokgung Palace and there is nowhere to purchase any food of any kind. There is a tea shop but it does only sell tea and coffee. Great tea but no nibbles. ',\n",
       " ' Absolutely Stunning! It became my favorite palace in Seoul! I loveeee the nature  old and preserve architecture it has. I can spend hours just looking around the stunning view.. They have guided tour in some languages too  make sure you go in the time   ',\n",
       " ' Typical Korea cultural The palace is well preserved and there are free tours to guide you round. It is just a short distance from train station. There is a palace guard changing ceremony here and you can check from the net on the ceremony time. Those who watch alot of korean drama should at least visit this place for once!',\n",
       " ' Very interesting Worth going on a guided tour. Very interesting and beautiful gardens. Takes around an hour to get around and I d recommend comfy shoes  not the suit and work shoes I was wearing!',\n",
       " ' Blast of the past To really appreciate Korean culture  I wanted to visit this amazing palace and immerse myself in the ornate beauty. I was not disappointed. The guards are dressed in ancient style finery and allow you to have pictures taken with them. Inside  you walk through one palace to another and can take photos of the interiors  which are dazzling. It s especially nice to do this on a day with good weather as it requires quite a lot of walking outdoors.',\n",
       " ' LONG Tour and lots of waiting We enjoyed our time there but it was a very long day. They only have three English tours per day of the Secret Garden area. You re only allowed to see those 75 acres during a tour. If you are not physically fit  this part may not be the place for you. It involves lots of walking  most up hills or stairs. It was 90 minutes long and we had to wait 3 hours before the tour began  we walked around the  castle  and its surrounding buildings. It was interesting if you re a history buff like my husband. I definitely don t recommend it with children. ',\n",

       " ' Nice World HERITAGE SITE in Seoul! Abolutely wonderful! This Palace is also called   The East Palace  according with its location with the Gyeongbokung Palace. One of the 5 Main palaces in Seoul  the different pavillions have been restored after several fires   but they say  very similar as they were before  and have very colorful decorations. I recalled one in particular  with its roof with beautiful Blue tiles..... splendorous! And the paintings in the Hall of the throne...  amazing! At the end of March  the Cherry trees were NOT yet in full bloom  only a few of them  son I would recommend you to visit this outstanding site in the first or second week of April.   I was a little mixed up and thought this Palace had the changing of the guard  but is NOT in this one   but in the Gyeongbukung Palace . Highly recommended attraction for everyone!',\n",

       " ' Palace number 2 in Seould  in terms of attractivity  For me this was palace number 2 in Seoul. Interesting and certainly worth a visit. If you haven t been there yet join one of the guided tours as certainly the guide can tell a lot about the history of the palace and the use of the different building within the outer walls.',\n",
       " ' Historic THE GOOD AND NEED TO IMPROVE THE GOOD I like the fact that they really preserve the place. They did a little renovation to preserve the place. Aside from stairs they have ramp for baby s stroller. Clean comfort room. I like the history of Korea that is why I enjoy the place  but if you are not  don t go. We are lucky that our Tour Specialist is very knowledgeable and was able to explain everything. every corner of the palace have their reason and purpose. NEED TO IMPROVE nothing! I like it just the way it is. very old and preserve. ',\n",

       " ' Beautiful Beautiful architecture and wonderful history. Be sure to go with a guide so you can get an overall feel of the history of this palace.',\n",
       " ' I love this place. Though not as huge as gyeongbok palace  Changdeokgung has a more romantic feel to me. I actually prefer this palace. Unfortunately  we missed the free English guide to this palace  so our information was limited to those written on the boards located outside the buildings. But since I m a fan of periodic dramas  I was able to roughly put together a nice story for my family ... though there were complains about my version    We were too late for the Secret Garden  but we did not mind it since it is still winter  so most of the trees are still bare. I definitely recommend a visit here .... it s not Seoul if you did not visit the palaces.',\n",
       " ' 3 in one palace Visit this place and buy the package. The place is worth the visit. Look at it in the perspective of history. We went here in winter but there is a bit foliage  ',\n",

       " ' Beautiful and tranquil Though not huge like the castles and palaces in Europe  the palace grounds were tranquil and spacious. The Secret Garden is a must see  with its beautiful pavilions and ponds. The hilly terrain is not recommended for those with knee problems though. Our tour guide was Kim  who was beautiful and eloquent. I wish I could spend more time here  it was probably the highlight of my Korea trip. ',\n",
       " ' One of the best This very pretty palace looks like it is one of the best kept of the five royal palaces. Worth seeing and walking through.',\n",
       " ' Palace in Korea It s nice to walk around during the day time. Peaceful place which located in the centre of Seoul. Walking distance from Anguk subway station. Make sure join the free guided tour. To visit the secret garden  you have to buy another ticket  which they sell limited number of tickets available to access to certain time. 1.5 hour walking guided tour. Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes due to you have to walk up the hill ',\n",
       " ' See the Palace and the Secret Gardens This Palace gives you two visits for the price of one  well  not really   you need to buy a ticket to see the secret garden too   so if you can only fit in one Palace in Seoul  this one might be for you. However  it is also right next door to Changgyeonggung Palace too  with an adjoining entry  so you might squeeze that one in too. We bought a combined ticket  which covered all four Palaces  the secret garden  and Jongmyo Shrine  and saved us money. Be sure you check opening hours   the Palaces and Shrine are not open every day. The Palace at Changdeokgung   you can walk around that by yourself  or go on a guided tour  do some research  as this doesn t apply year round . It has toilets and a caf  and pretty gardens without having to go into the secret gardens. When we were there  the last week of March  2016   the blossoms were just starting to come out on the trees   in one or two weeks time  it would have been sensational! As regards the secret gardens  a tour needs to be booked  and they do it in Korean  Japanese  Chinese or English at various times of the day . We arrived about half an hour before the first English tour  11 30am   and it was already fully booked  so immediately booked the next one at 1 30pm. Note  there are good coffee and food shops in the vicinity! . So you can t go into the secret garden without a guide. The guide stops in about 4 places  explains them  and then gives you about 10 minutes to wander around by yourself. The  secret  aspect to  the secret garden  is that only the King and his mates could enter them. There s some pretty pagodas and other buildings for resting  eating and cooking  King s gotta eat!   water features  and gardens. And also a couple of relatively steep slopes in case you were wondering. All very pretty.',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Palace The Palace and its grounds were sprawling. To think South Korea is not huge. So many nook and crannies to explore. Interesting short and different shaped doors  sections of the palace and quarters for their staff. How many people used to live there?   uhhhmm. It is quite a walk  so be prepared to wear comfortable shoes and recommend doing this in the morning when it is less warm hot. It s a shame they cordoned off going inside the rooms for a better look up close  but I guess the government has its reason for doing so. Famous sites including their theme park Everland via train subway is doable  make sure you ask for directions on what train to take and inform them of your destination and ask if the place is open on that particular day. Plan your trips so you can maximize to see the sites once you are in a certain area in South Korea specially if you are there for a short stay like us   5 days 4 nights..',\n",
       " ' Peaceful visit We decided to visit this palace instead of Gyeongbokgung mainly so we could visit the Secret Garden. The palace itself is not that large. It was peaceful walking through the complex as there were not a lot of tourists. However you couldnt enter into any of the buildings and only on occasion  get a peek into the rooms. If you like architecture then this is for you.',\n",
       " ' Interesting secret garden to explore If you have been to gyeongbukgong  you might feel that this is just another palace. However  this palace has a different feel from that of gyeongbukgong. It feels less imposing. To me  the main attraction was the rear garden of the palace. It s a little oasis right in the middle of Seoul city! Be sure to book the tour of the rear garden beforehand or to arrive in time for the guided tour of the secret garden. It s a long but enjoyable walk. Good walking shoes are definitely recommended!',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden! After visiting Gyeongbokgung  Changdeokgung is nothing too grand. The Secret Garden is the highlight of this place  so make sure you make your reservation online  no booking admission payment required until ticket redemption at the booth . They are very strict with the timing so do arrive 20 minutes before the tour time. We were 10 minutes earlier and we had to join the next session. It was early Spring time and the flowers hasn t bloomed so the secret garden wasn t at its prettiest. The place is very mystical  scenic and calming  ZEN. Our tour guide was super sassy  entertaining in a way. There ll be alot of walking so make sure you re in proper walking shoes! ',\n",
       " ' Historical and charming sunny day excursion I recommend this place to dress up and get some Korean style pictures on a sunny day. The old palace is the perfect setting for some great compositions of memorable pictures',\n",
       " ' Not impressed by the secret garden in March Seeing the garden is by tour only. We brought tickets for the palace and gardens when we arrived in the afternoon but because of the afternoon garden tour time we didn t get a chance to see the palace. We found the garden disappointing during our visit in late March. There was not much colour. Maybe it looks more attractive at other times of the year? We felt the tour guide did little more than walk us from one photo opportunity to another  and also felt the tour could have been done in half the time.',\n",
       " ' nice place! i went there just in time when the guards were marching with their national outfits. it was cool! the place was easily accessed when you travel by train or with the hop on and off bus.',\n",
       " ' Informative if you use audio guide While being able to listen to how courts people lived in the days thorugh an audio interface in english  be sure to grab it near the ticket office.   the place is overburdened with tourists. I recommend moving to the back of the palace to avoid crowd and then directly to the tallest building  which has a folk museum near it.',\n",
       " ' Empty palace on a large piece of ground This palace occupies a large tract of land like all palaces of importance should. What you find here is only the empty structure  suppose the secret garden would have made this more agreeable  but we were have no intention to wait for guided tour  and additonal cost to visit.',\n",
       " ' Very nice place Quiet surprise this palace still kept in good shape  a nice place for photos shooting. The changing guard show really interesting.',\n",
       " ' Love place! Love this place. I saw the changing guards and have a chance to take pictures with them. I paid about  5 to get inside. The place has some young men and women dressed in Korea outfit to walk around and stopped for pictures. They are love birds and felt that I was back to the pass and was walking in the palace hundreds of years ago. Not crowded at all  and it was pleasant to walk around. The trees was so nice and the short explore was a much do in Korea.',\n",
       " ' Gorgeous Gardens This site is great for history and nature lovers. I highly recommend going on the guided tour of the gardens. Otherwise  you ll only see a fraction of what this palace has to offer.',\n",
       " ' Another one of Korea s fabulous historic sites. ENjoy the ceremony of the changing of the guard where real Korean s are the actors dressed in their ceremonial garb.',\n",
       " ' Historic site attempts to come alive When I arrived at the site there was an hour left till the 1 30pm English tour. So to avoid the possible crowd I started to checkout the place and take photos. The size of palace is miniature compare to all others  which makes this one ideal as an  introduction  or  summary  of korea s nearest historical governance. My tour guide  Tian  knows the history well and is able to answer my questions about the palace  Korean history  and the emperor family. She was able to condense the tour to 30min for me to witness the guard exchange presentation at the gate by 2pm. Yes I recommend this place.',\n",
       " ' Most beautiful royal palace in Seoul To enjoy this marvelous palace  I recommend a guided tour which not only adds to the enjoyment but also provides many hidden stories of this palace and how it all ties to the history of Korea. Even without the tour guide  the ground is gorgeous and you can get lost several hours in there. If I were to choose one royal palace to visit in Seoul  this would be the one.',\n",

       " ' Amazing place! Consider that it was built in 1386 Our Viator guide was excellent. Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking. The  changing of the guards  is a bit hokey as there is no one to guard anymore but it is still something to see. The ingenuity of the Koreans to  invent  central heat was pretty neat. I can only imagine that the entire grounds will be covered in flowers within a few months.',\n",

It is surprising how they preserved the Palace after hundreds of years. The vibrant details of the roofs  the cornerstones  even the passageways remain the same as it was before.

We visited on the last Wednesday of the month and got free entrance into the palace  though still needed to pay for the Huwon entrance . The place provides free guided tours at the entrance. Just find the language you want and go ahead and join it  if you haven t already pre booked a tour . Didn t join the Huwon tour though coz we were catching a train to the outskirts. Anyway  it s true. The palace is lovely in winter with snow scattered on the pathways.   ',\n",

The palace is very impressive. It s so big you can barely take a picture of it. Definitely check it out.',\n",

Although leaves on the trees are all fallen  the buildings are stills pretty amazing. Tourists are only allowed to go into the garden at certain time with the guided tour. The tour guide was very helpful and really explained the idea behind each building and their layout. Tour is around 1.5hrs and basically hiking up and down the hill  because the garden was built on a small hill. The guide also recommended us to come back in the autumn.

The Changdeokgung Palace showcases palace grounds in harmony with nature  while the Gyeongbokgung showcases the grandeur and of the palace structures and its symmetrical order. Going on the tour of the Piwon Secret Gardens was a highlight  touring through the beautiful landscape around the hilly grounds.

We had an english speaking guide who told us the history of the palace and I have a personal guide with me who told me the love story of the king and prince  etc. The palace was partially destroyed but restored later hence some of the heritage is quite modernized. But there more of the palace that are still original and you can still appreciate the beauty of the buliding and the creativity of the craftmens. Somehow it didn t give me the sense of labor intensity when I walked around the palace unlike the Summer Palace in Beijing.

It s special because even though it s smaller than Gyeongbokgung  the grandiose first palace  it has such a pleasant peaceful feeling and a secret garden that makes it even more special. It s definitely worth the entrance fee and the time. Also  wear comfortable shoes. I wore newly bought ones and ended up walking the whole secret garden tour barefoot. Don t forget the bottled water either!! It s a life saver. Advice  buy a ticket for all three palaces at once  10000 . And do visit all of them. Every palace has it s own charm. You won t regret.',\n",
       " ' Nothing special There are better places in Seoul  like the Buddhist temple in Gangnam . The palace itself looks nice but it s empty and  new . If you ve been in China and Japan you will find this place worthless. ',\n",
       " ' Best Palace in Seoul This not too well know palace is a germ! Do not forget to visit the lovely gardens in the back! Even better then the Secret Gardens around the corner!',\n",
       " ' free and easy at Seoul Secret garden is a must when you visit this palace. The scenery is very beautiful at the secret garden but a lot of walking to do with 1and half hours of guided tours.',\n",
       " ' Hey Our guide was apparently a fan of PSY  which we found to be hilarious. Anyway  the narrow passages of this palace were very interesting to walk through  although the palace itself is not that different from the rest. Huwon  Secret Garden  is probably a lot more beautiful in spring summer  but it was still nice to walk through. While the free guided tours are a great way to encourage tourists to learn about Korean history  I do think that the guided tour of the garden is too long. One hour is more than enough to cover this part of the attraction  it takes 90 minutes   especially considering the fact that joining a guided tour is the only way one can see the garden.',\n",
       " ' The History of South Korea Great historical place to go sight seeing  the number of figures on the top of the roof represents the importance of the building.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful This was my favorite palace. So beautiful and full of nature! It s a great place for taking photos on a sunny day.',\n",
       " ' Old time revisit There are many Palace you can visit when in South Korea and Changdeokgung Palance is just one of them. Nice place to visit and get to know their history.',\n",
       " ' Classic Palace Don t miss the secret garden. An extra ticket but well worth it. We were there on the peak foliage week and the trees were magnificent. ',\n",
       " ' Great history So beautiful to see the royal buildings and get to know how it used to be before Japanese invasion for 35yrs which cleansed a lot of their history. I saw the guard change still done the way used to be. A must ... It s a travel in time',\n",
       " ' Good fun for entire family! I went here with my wife and a 4 years old. We all enjoyed being here. In fact  we think this is more enjoyable than the main palace. The secret garden was very nice even in the winter. It s very peaceful and the tour guide gave us plenty of time to explore and took photos. It was especially nice given there are few people in the group so it was more like a private tour for us. Not sure if that was because we went during winter time  we were there near Christmas . Just make sure to dress warm! We will definitely come again during warmer season',\n",
       " ' Nice visit Rich history and beautiful architectural design! The grounds are very clean  however  I m concerned the inside of the palace are exposed to the elements. ',\n",
       " ' Family vacation Good experience to see the structure design of the palace. Quite big and therefore have to do a bit of walking. ',\n",
       " ' Lovely way to pass some time. Interesting place to visit  very cheap  I think 100 won each. Wear trainers as it s quite a big site. Toilet facilities are available.',\n",
       " ' Relaxing place You can take a subway to this place  or if you stay near Jongno gu  you can walk. I recommend to visit this place in the morning as there are not many tourirts  and you can experience a peaceful time',\n",
       " ' Not very exciting! We did not find this palace very exceiting after having visited the Forbidden City in Beijing. Its very similar in design. We saw the change of guard ceremony  which was the only interestting thing during our visit.',\n",
       " ' Best Palace in Seoul Even though Gyeongbokgung get s recommended as the best palace most of the time  I prefer Changdeokgung with it s unique tour through the palace garden  also called  Secret Garden  . I think I finally managed to see the garden in all 4 seasons and all of them have their own charms.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful and rich in history. Beautiful place. Historic palace in Seoul. Rich in history. Many different buildings many of which were hand painted beautifully made.. Definitely worth checking out while in Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Really don t miss the Secret Garden We wanted to visit because it s a UNESCO World Heritage Site  but what we really enjoyed was the Huwon or Secret Garden. General admission ticket to Changdeokgung lets you wander around the main buildings of the Palace. To see the Huwon Secret Garden  you have to join the compulsory tour with a separate ticket  ticket combines general admission and tour . The  garden  is really the natural surroundings and wooded area that covers more than half of the Changdeokgung complex. The tour lasts 90 minutes so wear comfortable walking shoes. Also  check for Huwon tour times and what language you want  Korean  English  Chinese  Japanese  and time your visit accordingly to avoid disappointment. The Huwon Secret Garden is beautiful in how it was built to blend harmoniously with its natural surroundings. Buildings  pavilions  ponds and gardens are designed around the geography of the land and landscaping is minimal  a stark contrast to the typical palace complex which adopts a grid like plan. As beautiful as the gardens are  it s also rich in history. Your guide will also furnish you with the history of each structure and its purpose  be it library  study  contemplation or banquet. Overall  Changdeokgung was a more serene palace complex  we wandered around the main buildings and encountered less tourists than elsewhere. And maybe it s because we like history and nature  but the Huwon Secret Garden tour made this place a must see during our visit to Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Looking back in time It was a bright sunny minus 18 degrees celsius day when I wandered through the grounds of Changdeokgung Palace. You can t help but pause and consider how small and insiginifcant one individual is when contemplating the life of Kings as you peer into their accomodations and take in the palace grounds  some dating back to late 1300 s early 1400 s. The great thing about this Palace was being able to wander and discover all by ourselevs but also the hidden gems we found around corners that could be easily over looked. Take your time and enjoy one of Korea s national treasures and UNESCO listed sites. The entry fee is amazingly small!',\n",
       " ' Great Historic Palace Awesome to see a huge historic palace is preserved in middle of the busy city  great history and makes you feel you are time travelling back to history!',\n",
       " ' Neat to see the history I was there with a Korean friend who explained the history and how the Korean s lived. It was more enjoyable with a local s perspective  but would be neat to see even with out a  guide ',\n",

       " ' Stunning place Make sure you do the guided tour and wear Google shoes as there is lots of walking  the gardens are beautiful ',\n",
       " ' My favorite palace My husband is Korean. He took me here because he knew of all the palaces this would be my favorite. And it was. It was smaller than the other palaces  but that isn t saying much because this was huge still  I loved it for the natural beauty. It was breath taking. There was a little pond that you would surely miss if you didn t look for it and it was covered in green lily pads. We watched two ducks roam around the waters. This place was a gem in industrial Seoul!',\n",
       " ' In love Place time and art are amazing. In this huge modern world peace of history is standing and waiting to be explored. Palace is amazing garden looks wonderful and show was breathtaking. Worth going ',\n",
       " ' Winter visit This Palace is easily reachable by underground or taxi. Most beautiful trees with red leaves mixing other pine trees were all bald at winter time  so it not as colourful as it is in pictures shot in autumn. All buildings were the same and very plain  may interested those architectural lovers. We attempted to pay fee for the secret garden which must be entered with a tour guide but unfortunately one only time with a chinese tour guide on sunday  for the whole day  can you imagine how interested it can be. The palace charge extra money to enter the secret garden but the service is so limited and travellers take so much time to go there. Tour guides in English is also limited. And I did not think I saw any timetable for the secret garden at the main entrance  may be it is a little secret that should not tell travellers. The ticket seller  probably has limited english ability and will just answer the money you need to pay but nothing else. So if you go  it would be better to enquire the tour guide time for the secret garden if you do not want to miss the boat. ',\n",
       " ' Don t miss the Secret Garden This is a typical temple of the Korean royalty. But don t miss the special tour of the Secret Garden  it s not a secret .',\n",

       " ' History! We went here after we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace since it is close to each other. Its very similar with the Gyeongbokgung Palace. They also have an entrance fee of 3000 won and also offers guided tours. It is also on of the UNESCO heritage site in Korea I guess if you are into architecture and design this is a place to be visited.',\n",

       " ' worth visiting Secret garden is in this palace  you need a guide to access the garden. but the palace itself you don t need a guide. you can just enjoy the time yourself. It is in a walking distance with bukchon hanok village... so you can combine another attraction with this place. ',\n",
       " ' View into Korean History and Royalty We chose to go to this Palace over Gyeongbokgung based on recommendations by others. We took the Secret Garden tour which gave us a better understanding of the lives of the kings who resided in this palace. I would recommend you take the free tour when you go to the palace  it gives you a better appreciation of the grounds and monuments. ',\n",
       " ' Most Beautiful of the Seoul Palaces Smaller and more compact than the Gyeongbukgong Palace  but with access  for a small additional charge  to the this palace gardens.',\n",
       " ' Dream come true When I stepped in  I can t believe that I was actually at a place where I always watched this in Korean drama. It felt surreal!!! It was indescribable. The place is rich in history and makes me feel like I was brought back to time during those days. It is a place where Korean drama fans should not skip! Worth the trip.',\n",
       " ' Timeless Glory Beauty enriched by time. Walking through the palace grounds gives the visitor a sense of ancient Korea especially if you are a fan of Korean period dramas. The entrance is a massive gate adorned with colourful patterns and carvings on wood. Ticket is very reasonable especially if you buy the combination ticket for the five grand palaces of Seoul. This ticket includes the secret garden in this palace as well which I recommend you to see but once you reach the pavilion with the pond where the souvenir shop is you may stop there because the rest will be a long walk with tree lined uphill path and some more pavilion  nothing else. The Injeongjeon Hall is the throne hall of the palace. There are also small buildings which good picture backgrounds with less people like the Huijeongdang Hall. A map of the palace is essential.',\n",
       " ' Interesting perspective into Seoul s royal palaces Its worth taking a wander around this palace complex but the experience  for us  was made wonderful by our excursion into the extensive Secret Gardens. Be aware that it is really important to make reservations for the Secret Gardens online  well in advance. You can pay for the tickets on arrival but get your name down on the lists!',\n",

       " ' Huge palace grounds worth the walk Plan a few hours in here  the grounds are huge  and there are many nooks and crannies to visit. Best if you bring a guidebook that tells the story of what each section represents. From grandiose main palaces to servant quarters  take your time to soak in the history and beauty of the ancient times and gardens',\n",
       " ' Don t miss the secret gardens! A beautiful palace close to Anguk station with expansive gardens. Please note that you cannot walk around the secret garden alone and have to visit as part of a tour   English tours can fill up quite quickly so I recommend you go and confirm your time slot  then if you have time to wait you can visit the palace grounds or nearby attractions such as Gyeongbokgung or the Bukchon Hanok village ',\n",

       " ' Beautiful The day we visited the palace  it was snowing  Turned the Secret Garden into a fairy tale garden. Beautiful  convenient for wheel chairs and baby strollers. Guides  English  gave good explanations and time to take photos. Book guided tour to Secret Garden online to avoid delay and disappointment. ',\n",

       " ' Very beautiful   worth the visit We visited the Changdeokgung Palace during the Spring. It was beautiful. The gardens surrounding this palace are vast and worth visiting as well  so bring good walking shoes. Make sure to buy tickets before you are planning on entering the premises   there might be a wait  especially if you are planning on joining the guided tour  which I highly recommend. Tickets can be bought onsite in a small ticket booth.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace The palace grounds and buildings are very beautiful. There s a lot of walking involved. In the rear of the palace on the north side is the garden area or Biwon. You have to buy a separate ticket or pay for both palace grounds and biwon together. The garden was really interesting and beautiful but understand you ll be walking uphill a lot and can only go during a tour. They don t allow people to wander around by themselves. I dislike tours groups but there was nothing I could do. If you have a lot of time to sightsee around Seoul  try all the palaces. If your time is limited  pick either this one or gyeongbukgung  which is a few blocks away ...it s not worth cramming both into one trip to Seoul. IMO  I would pick gyeongbukgung since you also have the option of visiting 2 museums on the palace grounds as well as lockers to stash your bags. Also  5 line lets you out right under the entrance.',\n",
       " ' Best appreciated with a Guide Bigger than we expected! Plenty of quiet corners to appreciate despite the many tourists  best to get a personal Guide to enjoy the architecture and history of the palace.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace We had been to many similar palace s during our Asia trip  so we only noticed subtle differences. It felt like we were seeing much of the same from what we saw prior in China and Japan. Not taking anything away from the site  it was a great experience and well kept. If you havent seen one of these palace s before and you are in the area  worth the visit.',\n",
       " ' Nicer Palace especially the Secret Garden This Palace ground may not be as big as the Gyeongbokgung Palace but its Secret Garden behind is more fascinating. I would certainly come back again during autumn especially in early November to see the beautiful hues of the autumn leaves. We were there in late gloomy March and could only see few branches of cherry blossom. Be there at the right season to really appreciate its beauty!. Getting there is easy   about 400m walk from the Orang Line 3 Anguk Station. Entrance fee is 3 000KRW for just the Palace visit. Add another 5 000KRW if you want to visit the Secret Garden. Don t miss the Secret Garden as it is more interesting. Join the 90mins free tour to get a better understanding of the Secret Garden. This Garden is bigger than the Palace proper. You could also join a night tour of the Garden through advance booking. Happy Walking!!! After the Palace visit  you could visit the nearby Bukchon to see the picturesque hanoks.',\n",
       " ' Fantastic place Great palace to show how old people are leaving with fantastic place I went there by a taxi from myeongdong around 6000kw    5  and you can walk to there around 1.8 km The tickets 3000 kw and if you want with secret garden 8000 kw There time table to visit secret garden for foreign and it take 1.30 hours only rounding in secret garden ',\n",

       " ' Great palace with garden It was nice and the free english tour is a must have to learn more about the culture and how they use those houses before. If you stay at a hanok guesthouse like we did  you can walk to this palace. The secret garden also was nice to visit. Its longer then visiting the palace.',\n",
       " ' Very interesting visit Visited on a Saturday morning  a little busy but not overwhelming. Excellent guide  good English. First tour takes an hour around the main palace. Visit the secret garden it is well worth it. Tour takes an hour and a half. No food allowed but you can buy water half way round. It is a bit hilly but worth the trek. Make sure you leave enough time for your first tour and the secret garden. You reserve as specific time for the secret garden. Also the traffic was bad so if you are travelling by taxi leave enough time. Well worth the visit  a small piece of history in the centre of this modern city',\n",
       " ' Good palace 10 minutes away by taxi from our hotel Myeongdong area  we purchased royal palace which we can use for several palace  secret garden was included.. worth a walk',\n",
       " ' Very Interesting Tour Never visited this palace before especially for my husband  daughter and son in law neve had a chance to see what is Korea or Asia. They only knew from the TV and megazines. It was very educational and opening visitor s eyes to different time and culture. I enjoyed for my family.',\n",
       " ' Little bit of culture The palace itself is disappointing  but the secret garden is amazing. The garden is extensive and the tour is available in English. Personally found the tour to be a little crowded. Would have preferred to spend some quite time in the gardens instead.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Secret Garden The best part if this palace that distinguished it from the others is the Secret Garden. When we went there  the Secret Garden is only accessible via group guided tours and we are not allowed to wander off on our own in order to ensure the garden is well preserved. We booked for the guided English tour online before we flew to Seoul. Our lady guide was excellent  her English command is very good and at each place she would tell us the history and story behind the spots that we visited. Normally every year during Spring  they would also have night tours to the garden. Do note that the guided night tour is only open for foreigners an only available on 1 day or max 2 days per month   I think they chose the nights with full moon . Among the 5 palaces  I would recommend this palace to visit other than Gyengbokgung.',\n",
       " ' A Duplicate to Gyeongbokgung Palace I believe you do not need to visit Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. They are pretty much the same  though the tour we took at Gyeongbokgung Palace was better. The best part of Changdeokgung Palace was The Secret Garden. You can take the tour of The Palace  and then take the tour of The Secret Garden. The Palace tours in English are at 10 30AM and 2 30pm  the Garden is at 11 30  1 30 and 3 30',\n",

       " ' Expansive Palace Took the tour of the palace and then booked the secret garden tour as well which was really special and some interesting ponds and gardens to see along the way. Well worth the trip.',\n",
       " ' Historical palace that was modernized with electricity in the 1920s. This palace was modified in the the 1920s by the King to include electricity and our guide showed us ramps that the King had built to accommodate his car and the Queen s car. Though a UNESCO World Heritage Site  the modernization  though not readily apparent  rather ruins the historical perspective. Still  interesting to visit.',\n",
       " ' Best palace in Seoul thanks to the amazing secret garden I agree with the guidebook this is the best palace in Seoul. The highlight is the beautiful secret garden. The garden is nice in winter but on my return in Spring  I was amazed at how lovely it is. The landscaping is amazing and the tour guide will add some good information  the quality of tour guides varies the first in winter was great  the second in spring was OK but less interesting . Free tours are given of the palace but I the guide was not interesting for this tour I think he was inexperienced. The palace area itself is nice but remember that palaces in South Korea are more simple when compared to German palaces. Those that visited Germany will find the contrast interesting.',\n",
       " ' Nice Place at the outskirt of the city I went their in May 2016 from India. The place had an temp of around 24 degree Celsius. for me it was like waaoww... Nice palace in mountains with a beautiful scenery around. it is a small half and hour drive from Seoul city and an ideal place to spend your evening.',\n",
       " ' Interesting We booked in advance for the Palace and Secret Garden English guided tours. Both guides were informative and engaging. It was a hot day and we were quite exhausted after 2.5 hours but nonetheless a interesting break from all the shopping in Seoul. ',\n",
       " ' Enchanting Palace Wear a hanbok and get free entry to the palace! We enjoyed taking pictures in the palace. A must do is go online to book a guided tour to the secret garden. Although we had to pay for this but it is worth the time and money to enter this part of the palace.',\n",
       " ' Nice cultural sight Due to various korean soap operas that I ve watched  I was really interested in these special castles. It is a huge symbol of the pure korean or far east architecture. Fantastic garden in shape of a jungle with an awesome lake in the heart of it. Totally the environment is unbelievably soothing and relaxing. The main problem was its accessibility  public transportation is not really around the area and it took 30 minutes for us to get there from a subway station. ',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden Tour is Worth it! The garden in the palace is natural and beautiful. Felt so relax and could easily spend half a day strolling around myself. We did the walking tour which was great to get some insights on the history. ',\n",

       " ' Beautifuk Palace fitting into the landscape We took the Secret Garden tour with a knowledgeable English speaking guide. There are a lot of people who do this tour so I would suggest one to be early as they are punctual. A walk through this Joseon dynasty palatial grounds gives insight into the ways of the Korean royals. The secret garden covers a lot of the palatial grounds with many intricate and unique pavilions and ponds. The setting of these structures was done with much harmony with the landscape. A visit to this palace is absolutely worth it.',\n",

       " ' Beautiful gardens There is a lot of walking but it s worth it. No food allowed so eat before you come. Water only. This is my favorite of the 5 Seoul palaces.

       " ' Magical Moonlight Tour at Changdeokgung Palace Changdeokgung Palace offers a moonlight tour of the palace grounds for foreigners during the summer months on full moon nights. We booked the tour months in advance and it was worth every penny. The palace is beautiful but the only way to see the private  secret  gardens is to book a tour. We started the tour at the entrance gates where we were met by people dressed in traditional clothing. We were able to take pictures and then the tour began. We carried battery operated lanterns as we explored the grounds. Building and trees were lit so it was easy to navigate. As we walked the palace  performers played traditional instruments and folk songs in the background. It was quite romantic and magical to hear the music and imagine yourself wondering the grounds in dynasty times. The tour lead to a performance stage where traditional sweets and plum or cinnamon tea was served. We then watched several traditional performances that were beautiful. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and earpieces were provided so it was very easy to hear while on the tour. This is defiantly worth the money and it is must see in Korea. There is a lot of walking involved on the tour so wear comfortable shoes.',\n",
       " ' Just like you see it in the Korean serials..

       " ' Amazing Changdeokgung Palace is huge! When entering the palace  you would get the feel of the Jeoson era. You could imagine the Royalties walking through the corridors of the palace dressed in their royal garbs. Inside Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden  only accessible for when you join a tour. I would suggest to join the tour as it would give you more insight about the history of the garden and why it s given a special place.',\n",
       " ' Average site with little to see   and I miised the Huwon gardens One person s opinion  I have seen better Asian palaces. Changdeokgung also known as Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Seoul. It is one of the  Five Grand Palaces  built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty  but I do not think it was grand. This visit was part of a cruise ship 2 place tour  we booked it because we were afraid to take cabs from the Incheon port to the palace in Seoul   because of traffic. There was a lot of traffic  for sure  but there was no time saving on a bus vs. a private cab. I would take a private cab from Incheon port into the palace  if I could do this journey again. Missed it  I did not see the Huwon gardens and I did not know it even existed. Behind the palace lies the 78 acre garden which was originally constructed for the use of the royal family and palace women. The garden incorporates a lotus pond  pavilions  and landscaped lawns  trees  and flowers. There are over 26 000 specimens of a hundred different species of trees in the garden and some of the trees behind the palace are over 300 years old. This was not part of the cruise ship tour  but should be part of any new tour.',\n",
       " ' Spectacular by Night I visited the palace as part of my conference tour group. The Ministry of Tourism had made a special arrangement for my group to see the palace at night. It was a wonderful moonlight tour and even some of the Koreans in my group were so pleased because they had never visited this place at night. We were even treated to special cultural shows  which gave me a good appreciation for the rich and diverse Korean culture.',\n",
       " ' all outside so wear a hat Somehow I thought a palace would be an inside tour. Not this one. It is all outside and on a hot day there is little shade. Since it is central you have to expect traffic snarls to get there.',\n",
       " ' Go for the secret garden tour The general palace area is nice and sprawling  and on the weekday that i went  I could find places that were relatively quiet. When I arrived  I pondered a bit over whether to spring extra for the garden tour and I m glad I did. I can see why they need it to be guided as it s a wide open space with a few built up areas connected by paths. Letting people roam freely around historical buildings with little supervision would be way trouble. it can get crowded with the tour throng but the uniqueness of the pavilions makes it worthwhile.',\n",

We took a taxi from our hotel and took the English language tour  taxis are a bargain in Seoul . A Japanese colleague with us noticed that the Japanese language guide made no mention of the Japanese having once burnt this Palace.',\n",
       " ' Should have spent more time there Had reached the palace in the late afternoon. It is quite accessible  walking distance from Angguk subway station. About 5 to 10 mins walk. As it was spring time  the flowers are in full bloom  it was quite a sight to behold. Quite a different experience from that in Gyeonbokgong. Had wanted to visit the secret garden  but was closed by late afternoon. Nevertheless  it was a relaxing place to spend a few hours in. ',\n",
       " ' Historical Beauty The only reason I give it 4 stars  is that like many places in Korea they don t give information or notice about how much walking is required or the terrain. I took my parents here and they loved the rich history  the large spaces  but the walking  especially on a hot day in Seoul can be a lot. Make sure to go into the Palace and see the bench where the King would sit. It still smells musty and the old yellow curtains hang low. The best spot is the Secret Garden  but note this is a long walk with many steep hills and climbing.',\n",
       " ' Magnificent This was a great alternative to the more famous Gyeongbokgung Palace  which was closed on the only day I was in Seoul. The structures around the palace complex are magnificent and well preserved and the guide for my tour gave a lot of good info about the palace and its place in Korean history and culture.',\n",
       " ' Serenity Not as grand as the Gyeongbokgung Palace but a more peaceful and calmer place. Unlike Gyeongbokgung  Changdeokgung wasn t completely destroyed by the Japanese and reconstructed  so it has a special serenity almost palpable. The real draw for me is the Secret Garden tour. This is the rest of the palace complex  about 60  of the total area. You have to book online in advance  and the slots for a tour in English go fast. We were fortunately to get 2 of the last 3 slots for a late morning tour. The Secret Garden tour is quite a long walk across hilly terrain  but what a beautiful place! A royal refuge indeed. Pity the royal tombs were closed to conservation. My advice is to plan ahead and make your booking way in advance  and bring a good pair of hiking shoes.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace Nice place to check out probably can do this in an hour and just check out the main palace without walking around everywhere as it gets a bit boring after an hr. I missed the changing of the guard if you can when the change guards will be a better experience',\n",
       " ' A trip back in time The real star of this place is the Hiwon  secret garden area. It s about a 55 minute tour and be sure to bring good walking shoes. The secret garden tour fills up fast and they offer it to English speakers only a few times a day so come early to get a ticket  an extra cost to the general admission ticket  If you purchase the combination ticket book you just have to show your secret garden part of the book to get a ticket.

       " ' Excellent palace steeped in heritage The palace is steeped with heritage and history and is declared so by UNESCO. The rooms are decorated very well and each room has its purpose of having. The Kings throne and the feast he would have is very interesting to watch. A must visit for all. I went twice to visit',\n",
       " ' Doesn t take too long if your time is limited Because of time limit I could only visit this Palace. I couldn t afford more free time. I could enjoy at least a short aspect of this culture. The secrte garden will remain secret only guided visit is allowed. Again not enough time!',\n",
       " ' Beautiful gardens in tune with the surroundings Sadly most of South Korea has been devastated by wars or fires  so most of the buildings of historical significance have undergone many renovations and rebuilds to present a picture of  old life . The Changdeokgung Palace is a lovely place  which was originally built in 1405. Full restoration work began in 1991 and continue today. Many local young people visit wearing full traditional dress  which gives visitors a chance to take lovely photos.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden is must visit It was a rainy day but we already booked a tour in the Secret Garden. The secret garden tour was totally worth it. There a lot of hiking and walking so wear comfortable shoes. If you are wearing hanbok  can be rent from a shop opposite the palace   you can a free entry to the palace  not the secret garden . It is the best location to do some photoshooting as well. There are only one place where the toilet is in the palace and another one in the secret garden.',\n",
       " ' Pleasant but lacks awe For a royal palace this does seem a little stark  the buildings whilst undoubtedly historic are not noteworthy in themselves the roofing is impressive. Nice gardens at the top to wander around and it is a very peaceful spot. Worth a trip certainly but will not have you swooning in awe. Definitely take the special garden tour  the highlight.',\n",
       " ' Good Palace to visit The palace itself was well kept  and manageable in size to visit. Nothing spectacular if you have already coming from China and went to the Forbidden City  for example  but if this is one of your first palaces  I think is worthy. ',\n",
       " ' A highlight for any Seoul trip You don t need to budget a whole half day here  but certainly make it an early morning or late afternoon stop. A visit is worth cost of admission  and if you like history  try to link up for a guided tour  or at least the audio tour   it s well organized.',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Very beautiful and well kept the Koreans have gone to great detail to preserve what the great kings left. I found every detail worth the visit.',\n",
       " ' Fantastic time We did the Moonlight tour which only happens less than 10 times a year and I must say that the tour was an incredible experience  walking inside the palace at night with the light in the garden ... The secret garden during the night will be my best memory from Seoul. ',\n",
       " ' An interesting and historical palance with Western setting A small palace where you can spend one or two hours. They also have changing guard with two shows a day  check their new schedule first  otherwise you will miss it.. At the entrance  look for some young ladies who are wearing a yellow t shirts. They are students from the local school and they volunteer to be tour guide. This service is free and they are a bunch of friendly and helpful people. Perhaps this is part of their history  so most of them are very knowledgeable with all part of the palace and can walk through each part with you. They are very proficient with English and some times can be humor too. After the tour  it is optional to complete a survey for them and they will bring back to their school. This palace is comparatively small with the Grand Palace  but each section has its own functionality. The secret garden is very beautiful. We are lucky to enter for free because that week was their Golden Week  otherwise  you have to pay Won3000 per person  but the cost is worth for it.',\n",
       " ' Rotary Convention Our annual Rotary International convention was held in Seoul Korea this year. We took a few extra days for sightseeing. This Palace was one of the highlights for me. I love history and I love beautiful things. This inexpensive tour combines both of those. I love the way it Korean culture honors its history. This is a beautiful place to visit without spending too many dollars. You can do the whole thing in an hour or two. I also very much enjoyed the museum adjacent to the Palace. Air conditioned and a nice restaurant inside it was a good diversion in the middle of a hot day. If you can do this with the tour guide it is even better. Too many things that you simply would not understand without having a guide.',\n",
       " ' Nice experience Very similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing... This place is smaller than Forbidden City but the architecture are as elaborate as compared... Good to experience once...',\n",
       " ' Not worth the time We had the English guide take us around the compound. There was one point we had to climb steep slopes. We paid extra for a ticket into the secret garden. More like a peek into history for a day. Won t come again. ',\n",
       " ' Better of the 2 imperial palaces My guide book said this one is the smaller and less impressive of the two imperial palaces. I disagree. The ground seemed bigger  more buildings and a  secret garden . The garden requires a separate ticket but worth the money. As with the  bigger  palace  there are many building that you cannot walk into  just look into. There grounds are more landscaped  even outside of the  secret garden  . If you only have time to go to one palace  go to this one.',\n",
       " ' Don t miss the Secret Garden! The tour of the palace is truly great  but the real gem is the Secret Garden tour. Don  t miss it! You may want to check before hand  so you re not disappointed  but the Secret Garden tour runs only occasionally. You are truly in an oasis in the middle of the beautiful city of Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Disappointing The palace is considerably smaller than Gyeongbok Palace but this was expected since based on the review I read  it is not the main royal palace. One of the reasons my friend and I went to Changdeok Palace was its Secret Garden  as it is one of UNESCO s World Heritage Sites. The way it was advertised was that it is a very splendid and romantic place but the reality was far from it and in my opinion  it is not representative to be a royal garden. Even worse was that we had to pay separate entrance fees for the palace and the garden and that of the garden is more expensive.',\n",
       " ' Cloudy day worth to visit with a guide It was a cloudy day when we visited this palace of the last king of Korea. Luckily we managed to join an english tour  2.30pm to find out more about the history of this palace. We didn t join the secret garden tour  3.30pm as it was kinda drizzling and we don t have any umbrella with us today. The secret garden was where the king spent most of his time together with his most beloved concubine   whom he couldn t make as his first wife as he wasn t allowed to choose his own wife  He built a house for her next to the garden   something unheard apparently   showed how much he loved her  ',\n",
       " ' Grand and interesting The strange history concerning how many times it has been destroyed and rebuilt  portions at least  is fascinating. And from far it looks small but as you approach you see the intricate details and great attention that was laid to each element that makes it so beautiful. There were lots of people  but I found that charming. It was good to have a tour guide to tell us about the nuances of the structures and the layout and some of the stories that make a place so much richer. Not good to go on a rainy day. Worth a visit if you have the time   about 1 30 2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive. If you get a chance walk around the area in the city because there is lots to do there as well  not just sightseeing. ',\n",
       " ' Serene and Beautiful Secret Garden Although the Palace itself is grand and worth visiting  what stood out was the Secret Garden. On a cloudy  breezy afternoon  meandering through the garden was delightful. But as there are only guided tours of the Secret Garden and a limited number of visitors are allowed each day  its best to book in advance. Can be easily done on the Changdeokgung Palace website. There are guided tours in different languages including English and Japanese.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace The main palace is beautiful but you definitely have to visit the Secret gardens. We visited in summer  but I guess the garden will be beautiful in Autumn and Spring. There are only two English tours to the secret Garden in a day and that s a problem. You cannot visit the Secret Garden just by yourself.',\n",

       " ' Nice place If you have time for only one palace in Seoul  go here and do the garden visit  guided tour only and quite long . The palace itself is nice  same architectural design as many palaces and temples in Korea. The gardens have a great serene atmosphere and allow you to see really nice parts of the palace complex.',\n",
       " ' Nice palace This was the only palace I visited in Seoul and I was glad I visited this palace. It was worth it. The palace is not as big as the palaces in Beijing but it is still as beautiful. We met Korean actor Lee Dong Wok who was shooting a korean drama on our way here. He was very friendly and handsome . Overall..make sure you visit this palace and then take a short break at one if the cafes nearby. ',\n",
       " ' Wear sneaker to go up! I didn t think about the trail to get the secret garden so I just used sandal and it was hard  but doable for me because I m pretty good hiker. I figured out this palace style tend to be Korean style which is built base on nature environment. ',\n",
       " ' Colorful but the grounds are bare The colors on the inside of the main temple were impressive but the rest of the grounds were not that impressive. There is a museum right next door  we wandered into it from the palace grounds  that I really enjoyed. If you find that  go in! it s air conditioned. ',\n",

       " ' Nice stop for a few hours My wife and I spent a little over 3 hours here including the Secret Garden tour. We guided ourselves through the main palace area using the maps and posted signs. It was very interesting to try and imagine what life was like hundreds of years ago in such a place. The Secret Garden is a very nice add on and is guide led. Our group was rather large  but once you start walking around it seems smaller. The guide was informative but gave us plenty of time to explore each stop. There were some hills involved so be wary if you have trouble walking on inclines. ',\n",
       " ' My Favorite of the Palaces I found Chandeokgung to be the most beautiful of all the palaces  and I visited them all! I took two free English language tours. The first one  a tour of of the buildings and explanation of the history was very hood. The second tour  of the Secret Garden  was only okay. I could barely understand the guide and the Secret Garden was pleasant  but not as impressive as the name conjured. But I was there just before spring  and I suspect it would have been much prettier with the flowers blooming and the trees leafing out. But the palace was  WOW! ',\n",

Only guided tour are available in the secret garden.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace The palaces were so beautiful but practically enjoyed Changdeokgung because of the spring flowers and Cherry blossoms outside. I can t recommend the Secret Garden tour for those who are not fit or elderly though as it is really a struggle. We went there early April so the trees are still bare and there were only few spring flowers here and there. Still it was a nice experience.',\n",

These are in limited   so you must sign up in advance! Just sign up online at the official palace website. It was very easy! This palace is full of history and no wonder they sealed off a portion of the palace grounds to general public to preserve its history and architecture. ',\n",

The other one   Gyeongbokgung   is more Chinese style which gates and building are all lined up. Even the main gate for this palace is situated in the corner. And they didn t cut down on hills and trees. So it s pretty much of hiking in the city if you take the full course. The palace part is open to everyone except every Mondays  but the secret garden   something more famous   must be reserved beforehand. If you are a small group  there usually are some tickets available at the spot  but I wouldn t risk it. Just reserve it online first. The garden is beautiful and huge and the hills are haha endless. Better wear sneakers. No tough shoes.',\n",

The buildings are really splendid and the gardens around very pleasant  blossoming these days with zillions of Korean teenagers in traditional costume spending the day to make selfies..... .Overall a similar sense of emptiness is nevertheless also present. These palaces are empty or closed... so despite thence architecture  it s like walking around something you d like to  really  visit but can t. A bit frustrating. Nice place though.',\n",

After walking around the garden you will be too tired too!',\n",
       " ' don t take the Secret Garden tour if you are not fit! The palace was pretty nice. This was the only palace I visited in Seoul so I have no other comparisons. One strong word of advice is that if you are not fit  elderly  need assistance with walking  or you have toddlers  prams and such  do not take the  Secret Garden tour . Before the tour started  we heard someone ask the palace tour guide if there were a lot of slopes and he replied that it was mainly gentle gradient. This was not true. The slopes were steep! Coming down was easy but going up was a struggle for quite a few people. There were also steep stairs made of rocks which you need to climb. Certainly not advisable for those with strollers.',\n",

If you want to have the tour of the Secret Garden and you bought the combination ticket  go to the ticketing office first to convert the voucher to a ticket in going to the said tour. We had the 3 30 English tour and it ended at around 5 though what my friend and I was we went ahead of those who had the English tour and savoured the moment of taking pictures of sceneries and ourselves.

       " ' Superb Secret Garden! While not the biggest palace  this is probably the most visited of the 5 palaces in Seoul. While the biggest palace  Gyeong bok gung  Gung means palace   Chang deok gung was the most preferred palace of the king and his queens  chiefly for one reason  the SECRET GARDEN  which covers  60  of the total palace area. While the palace itself can be entered with a ticket of KRW 3 000 and without a guide  the secret garden has a separate entrance within the palace  and ticket  and can only be accessed with a guide. Each guided tour lasts 90 minutes and tours are run in English and Korean languages  there might be other languages  but am sorry not sure about which ones  maybe Chinese and Japanese as well . The palace itself is open from 9AM to 5PM on all days  Mondays closed . Another important piece of advice  each tour has a cap of 100 joiners and while there are 3 4 English and 4 Korean tours every day  except Mondays  and they sell our pretty fast  apparently 50 passes per tour can also be booked online  though I haven t tried it personally. So unless you are staying for a few days and want to try your luck  try booking the pass in advance. A palace cum garden ticket can be obtained at the main entrance for KRW 8 000. I actually missed the Sunday 3 30 PM  last English tour  and was almost disappointed until I came out and realised that there were 2 Korean tours available for 4 PM and 4 30 PM  ending at 5 30 and 6 PM  even though main gates shut at 5 for new entrants . As it was the last free day I had in Seoul I joined the Korean tour  which was the second best option. Really enjoyed the stunning beauty and grandeur of the secret garden  complete with small ponds with large umbrella esque shelters for the royalty to sit by  waterfalls  and beautiful halls inside  not to mention flower beds and courtyards. And  the Korean guide realised that I had missed the English tour and was kind enough to summarise the brief to me after others had been informed and given time to click pictures. A must do in Seoul  apart from Gyeong bok gung  for the Change of Guard ceremony at 10 AM and 2 PM daily except Tuesdays when it is closed .',\n",

Just buy your ticket and wait for the next group tour in your language  Korean  Chinese  Japanese  English . Changdeokgun is also known as Biwon which is the name given to the Secret Garden behind the palace buildings. The garden is really stunning with ponds  and a library  off limits  situated in the garden. At one point  climbing a steep hill  I felt like I was trekking through a forest. There is also a 750 year old Chinese Juniper tree on the grounds  not to mention other trees that are hundreds of years old. The palace has a sad history    during Japanese rule  it was turned into a zoo. It is beautifully restored now. Of interest are the unpainted servants quarters. ',\n",
       " ' Amazing We took a half day walking tour that included the old town and the palace. The architectural features of the palace and the history  along with stories of the royal family  made this a must see. ',\n",
       " ' The gardens are very beautiful. The Palace is interesting to visit  and easy to get to. I was on a business trip so very little time for sight seeing so the Palace was a place that I could take some time out to see.',\n",
       " ' Photogenic UNESCO site I went twice to this palace. The palace ground is huge. Well maintained corridors. It is free for the public on certain holidays. Check the official website. I rented a hanbok and therefore I got in for free. ',\n",
       " ' I confuse those two palaces and so does the map The official Seoul tourist map suggests that this palace is above and the other one is close to the metro station. Yet it seems to be a bit different and I got really confused as I thought I was in the other palace. The main gate  from the south west corner off the park  next to the metro station  will get you to this Palace. The other one is more on the east of the park. You can walk from one palace to the other without getting out from the park. Both of the palaces are really nice but lots of open space thus on sunny day make sure you have a hat otherwise you ll end up with a mild sun stroke.',\n",
       " ' One of the most palaces I have seen. This place compares internationally and has a majestic character uniquely its own. I have seen some of the most prominent European palaces and this one is up there with the best. It would be fair to say that every single wooden element is a piece of art in its own right. As far as I was able to tell the entire building is made of wood with no  visible  metallic elements. The wood is meticulously hand painted with stunningly articulate floral patterns. The walls and ceilings are decorated with traditional symbolic paintings. This is a must see and highly recommended. ',\n",

       " ' Review of the Secret Garden We went by the place very quickly on our way to the Secret Garden. The garden was pretty and it was interesting to see where the royals relaxed  entertained guests and where the prince studied. The garden would be more beautiful during the fall foliage or the spring summer bloom. The tour was 90 min and require quite a bit of walking and some stairs. Would not recommend for those with difficulty walking. The guide was quite knowledgable and shared some good information. ',\n",

It is part of the Secret garden complex that can only be seen with a tour group  at the palace ticket counters about W5 000  There are both korean and English tours but they do sell out fast over weekends with good weather. ',\n",
       " ' Visit the Secret Garden in Changdeokgung Palace We had visited the Geongbokgung Palace the last visit and thought we needed to view the Secret Garden and naturally visit Changdeokgung Palace. The palace is rather small and the highlight would the garden.For this you have to go on the website and make a booking. We chose to go on Christmas Day thinking it would be quiet but our group was large  at least 30  sure reminds of my school trips! . Give yourself half an hour to visit the actual palace itself. I loved the garden as it was huge  sitting in an area much bigger than the palace. It was a hunting ground for the king in the olden days so as to give you an idea how large it was. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of Seoul! However  you can only visit with a guide and therefore cannot enjoy it as much as it should be. I love to sit and watch the world go by so that is not possible. Lovely and well worth a visit. ',\n",
       " ' The Secondary Palace of the Korean Emperor We came here on Tuesday because the Main Palace was closed that day. Nevertheless  this palace is quite lovely to visit and explore its beautiful exteriors. This palace was close to Buchon Hanok Village  so that was our next stop that day. ',\n",
       " ' I love this Palace I went to Gyeongbokgung palace before I came here. We could walk there  but we used the Gyeongbokgung station to Anguk station instead  from here  we walk along Bukchon Hanok Village  then straight to Changdeokgung.  we bought combination tickets for 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine  and I was surprised these include the Secret Garden in this palace  otherwise we need to pay extra 5000 for the tour  I think it is more well preserved than the Gyeongbokgung palace. I love this place more  you can walk along the path of the ancient people of Korea and the Royals used to walk. Personally  it was an amazing experience for me. Some of my friends got tired easy though  I guess it s not for everyone. Lots of picture taking activity.',\n",
       " ' The Garden is the highlight of the tour The palace is interesting but the garden is the real reason for the visit. The English tour was well delivered by a woman that had excellent knowledge and great command of the English language. We timed it well during the spring foliage season. I would imagine that it may be less dramatic during a dry season.',\n",
       " ' Korean palace in middle of Seoul Great palace with a big beautiful garden. We did English tour for both the palace and the garden. The tourguide for the palace was very good and i learned a lot. I got little out from the tourguide for the garden but I believe you can t just wander around by yourself in the garden so it is mandatory. The garden is beautiful so worth doing it.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden The highlight of Changdeokgung has got to be the Secret Garden  which must be visited with a guide and lasts 90 minutes with small breaks in between.The walk won t be easy for someone who has knee problems as it will have about 3 short but steep trails to hike. General palace admission including the Secret Garden costs 8 000 and it is closed on Mondays. Please make an online reservation for your tickets from their official website as it runs out fast.',\n",

       " ' Royalty reigns A perfect palace to visit if you have only limited time. Entry price includes a tour at set times for various languages. Well worth it. If you can spare the 1.5 hrs for a Secret Garden tour  the other tourists say this is well worth it. Well maintained and lovely grounds with a rich Korean history.',\n",

       " '  Secret Garden Tour    definitely worth a visit Have been to Seoul a few times already but this time was the first time I had visited this palace. We opted for the additional Secret Garden tour. I am so glad I did  as the gardens were truly beautiful. The gardens can only be viewed by taking part in the guided tour. It was conducted by a quide who s english was clear and easy to understand. She was quite humourous and informative throughout. The only thing I would say is that the tour lasts for 1.5hours and involves some inclines  so comfortable walking shoes are a must. Definitely worth a visit.',\n",
       " ' Nice place This palace is said to be built during the Josun period in the 14th century. Overall the place is nice and beautiful. The interesting part is the main building like a royal court  where there s an interesting dragon decoration high up in the ceiling where visitors can only see it from a certain angle. It s beautiful. There s also a cafeteria and souvenir shop in one of the buildings inside the palace s grounds.',\n",
       " ' Night view of secret garden It s an amazing experience to visit the palace at night. Although it only opened during moonlight but we are managed to do so in our visit to Seoul. It s a nice experience to see and experience to the culture. ',\n",
       " ' Fascinating and beautiful Highly recommended for a visit. This huge Palace complex is a fine example of Korean historical architecture and culture. The grounds were stunning  particularly in Autumn   it s a photograper s dream  particularly with the young local people dressed in traditional dress   a lovely  popular current trend . Very reasonable entrance fee and so much to see there. ',\n",
       " ' Sightseeing of Seoul This historic palace was the seat of power at one time and was built in the 1300 s. The pomp and pageant including the changing of the guards to the palace entrance is still maintained. The palace and various royal activity houses and the gardens is spread over a vast area which occupies the central Seoul. The plants and various flora were in full bloom and looked stunning. It was very tiring walking between various buildings and gardens but there were places to rest and eat. To see it properly one would need to spend a full day  but we only had a half day so the visit felt very rushed.',\n",
       " ' Palaces and museum Aside from palaces  they also have a secret garden. They too offer variety of korean restaurant however  the vietnamese resto was perfect for a hungry stomach.',\n",

       " ' to be fair the palace is quite lovely  and would probably be much nicer in the spring  or summer when plants are in bloom. as for the winter visit  there was a lot of large open space  so the wind was blowing  and the temperature quite low. the buildings themselves are lovely. you cannot enter any of them  you just stand at the top of the steps   3 5 steps usually  and look into the buildings. however i did start to watch a movie on the flight home called  the king s case note    by coincidence  and it was filmed inside the actual buildings of the palace  so i got a really good idea of how the king would have lived  and what it would have looked like many years ago!',\n",

       " ' Seoul family vacation As part of our tour package we visited this place. It is a UNESCO World heritage site. I saw the main hall  the king residences  the queen residences and members of the royal families where they have stayed. All buildings are in harmony with the environment surrounding them. Truly a historical site worth coming to visit. Thanks ',\n",
       " ' Unclear prices I was really unimpressed with the signage out the front to enter to the gardens you need to pay again inside and it is close to the price of the pass for all the palaces. we would have bought that if we had known but this was not indicated on the price lists.',\n",
       " ' Prettiest Palace in Seoul For me  Changdeokgung is the prettiest palace I went to. I ve seen Gyeongbukgung  Deoksugung  and Hwaseong Hanggung. The area is compact and landscape has a lot of beautiful plants. Best season to go would probably be spring and autumn. Also tried the Secret Garden tour. I takes a bit of physical activity to go through the garden. I was quite a hike. I didn t expect it so we took a longer time touring this place than what we planned.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful! Spent a couple hours here in early Jan. it was very cold so make sure to rug up because there is nowhere to go to keep warm. The place is huge and buildings are beautiful. Took a taxi from here to myeongdong and it was very cheap  4000 w. You could also walk across the road to insadong. ',\n",
       " ' Secret garden excellent I m not usually one for wandering around scenery but I was really happy with the secret garden tour. Granted  the group was quite big 40  ish people  and the tickets tend to sell out  so pre book or turn up early. Despite it being winter there were still nice photos to be taken. The little cafe near the secret garden entrances does some deliciously warming thick rice teas. But the 5 stars especially is because the helpful ticket clerk  instead of just selling me the secret garden and admission for I think 8000W  she checked if I was visiting other palaces  when I said yes  she highly recommended I buy the combined ticket and even asked me to have a good read of the info available before buying. She saved me several thousand Won as the combined ticket was 10 000 Won and I used it to get into 3 palaces  Secret Garden and JongMyo shrine. Really appreciated her thoroughness and helpfulness.',\n",

It s remarkable to think that less than five minutes from the serene atmosphere of this palace  and some of the surrounding streets  that you re confronted with a grim duel carriageway bloated with traffic. I like these contrasts in Seoul.',\n",

       " ' Worth Seeing Once This was OK to see once. It didn t make me want to go out and visit the other 4 palaces afterwards. But you learn a bit about the history and you ve gotta visit at least one palace while you re in Seoul. Otherwise  it was a large area with some old buildings  and some re built ones  that didn t necessarily translate a sense of the importance of the place. ',\n",
       " ' TOP palace sight on Seoul More serene and beautiful  but less grand compared to Gyeong... palace. Make your way to the Secret Garden for series of pavilions. It was predictably dry due to the winter season. Must be a pretty sight in spring  autumn and summer.',\n",

       " ' See what the King s saw This palace is my favourite palace between the other 3 palaces. The secret garden is so beautiful and enjoyable to see.',\n",
       " ' Additional fee to access the secret garden We paid the first 3000 Korean won for the main entrance admission. We explored a few areas  and found it a bit underwhelming because it kind of looks similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace. We then went on to the next area  the secret garden  where there was an additional fee of 8000 won to enter. I guess it will be kept a secret because we opted not to enter. We were probably  Palaced out  after we thoroughly explored Gyeongbokgung Palace.',\n",
       " ' Fabulous! Don t Miss This! Changdeokgung is one of my highlights of my week long Seoul trip. Absolutely fabulous! We were lucky that our hanok host helped us prebook the Secret Garden Tour. I heard tickets are hard to get  especially during Autumn foliage season  and can get sold out as fast as within the first 10min the system is open for booking. Our guide was entertaining and shared many stories about the royalties  as well as the palace architecture. Now I understand why some of the doors are built so low... The pace of the tour was relaxing. There were some steps  upslope  towards the end but nothing difficult. I don t consider myself fit and or athletic  but I had no problems keeping up with the group. My two little kids managed very well too! You may want to visit the loo before the tour. There is only one toilet break during the 90min tour. No outside food and drinks allowed. So perhaps a snack before the tour would be a good idea  if you are visiting near lunch time .',\n",

Recommended season would be fall.',\n",

It was very interesting to see such an ancient place with so much history. Wheh I was there the tour guide told us that there are usually a lot more people visiting the site but for some reason  the Chinese government put a travel ban on SK. All in all a cool place.

       " ' Beautiful palace with a huge garden to explore   wear your walking shoes! Changdeokgung Palace is one of the two largest and most visited palaces in Seoul. They are similar in many ways   well preserved  beautiful  with extensive grounds and many buildings to explore   but Changdeokgung has much larger grounds  which you can tour if you have a special ticket. When you first arrive  you can buy an entrance ticket to the palace  and at the same time can ask for an entry ticket to the  Secret Garden.  This allows you entry at a specified time but doesn t cost anything extra. I ve gone twice and once they just let us in at that time and we were free to wander at will. The second time  there was an English speaking tour guide who showed us a few of the most important sights within the garden. It is amazing how quickly you feel immersed in nature  even though you know you are in the center of a bustling city. It is so quiet and serene   just the thing when city life gets too overwhelming. Definitely wear your walking shoes   the paths are smooth and wide  but the garden is very large and hilly so it requires a bit of stamina to see it all. Young children or anyone with limited mobility will find it tough to see the whole thing.',\n",

We decided to take our place in the queue as in the few minutes we pondered what to do next  the line was growing by the minute. The wait to get tickets was around 30 minutes   which I didn t mind a bit as it was fascinating watching the locals  young and old arrive in their beautiful traditional dress. The Palace offered lots of history and insight into the culture. Constructed in 1405 as a secondary palace of the Joseon Dynasty and rebuilt in 1610 after being destroyed during the Japanese invasion. It then served as the main palace for 270 years. The Koreans in traditional dress added to the intrigue. We paid extra to go into the secret garden and were pleased we had. The autumn colours were beautiful. We didn t do a guided tour due to the next tour not being an English one. We didn t feel we missed out on anything not doing the guided tours  we had a good brochure to guide us around.',\n",

Its easy to get to the Palace either by bus or taxi...for us tourists      .. . I wanted to learn more about Korean people  their history and interaction with other Countries  how Korean culture developed and Korean loyalty and steadfastness. . I visited the Palace in mid November 2017   it was cool with a light breeze .  Inside the grounds it was quiet and tranquil and we walked through my friend explained what the different buildings were   why they building  wing  was built  for whom and when it was built. . We joined an English speaking guide who guided us through and explained why and when the smaller buildings were built and how the buildings were heated during the cold winters. .. MANY THANKS to the guide.. she did an excellent job of explaining in detail.. her English with an eastern American accent was easy to understand .. At a small hill there was a lake and stream that flowed to the lower part and a building where the Imperial family performed annual rituals to honour the planting and harvesting of crops.. .i saw others were dressed in colourful traditional Korean clothing.. later I found out that these were tourists who had rented these. .

For example  it does offer a bit more history and authenticity as it is quite a bit older than the other palace which was only recently rebuilt. A major part of the palace are the hidden gardens which were closed when we were there.

Everything is so cold you could barely hold anything. An intense feeling of numbness permeates my hands while holding my iPhone to take pictures. The freezing cold did not stop us from visiting the Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul Korea. It is a look of a true Korean beauty. It was built in 1405 as a Palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was consisted of so many halls most of which were huge and spacious and were used for the most formal state events  coronation ceremonies and receptions of foreign envoys. A beautiful secret garden Is situated at the back of the Palace which enhanced the unique architectural structure of the pavilions and was intended as a place for relaxation of the King and his royal family. It was also used as a venue for various activities to include sports competition most notably in archery during those days. To better appreciate the history of the Palace there is a guided tour in English for a minimal fee. There is also a small fee for admission to the secret garden and the main Palace itself.',\n",

       " ' A must see for any visit to Seoul Wonderfully beautiful in history  tradition and architecture. Many locals opt to rent traditional outfits and come to the Palace to pay their respects. Selfies galore and of course people taking photos of groups and so on. I especially loved the idea that during the week there were many school field trips so the grounds were abundant with young people....and young people love to practice their English on you. Had a ball meeting and conversing with so many locals.',\n",

       " ' Stunning palace with beautiful gardens For me this was my favourite palace in Seoul. I also visited the larger Gyengbokgung Palace  which although impressive I feel could not compete with the beautiful secret garden at Changdeokgung. I would definitely recommend doing the secret garden tour  our guide was wonderful and very informative. ',\n",
       " ' Secret garden not a garden Went to see the secret garden. In winter  at least  there is no garden to see in the sense of plants or landscapes. Rather this is a tour of the private palace buildings that you can t otherwise access. Quite interesting and a good guide  but don t expect beautiful plush interiors that you d see in British or European palaces   these are external views with a few empty rooms. OK but not a must do. ',\n",
       " ' Takes You Back in Time... Went there during Chuseok time and a lot of people came wearing hanbok so it really felt like we traveled back in time. Too bad my friend and I didn t get to rent out one for ourselves. It was during Hanbok Festival when we visited so there were long lines of people waiting to get their handbok in the shops outside the palace. My friend and I didn t want to waste our time lining up so we just went in. The palace s entrance fee is cheap but if you go wearing hanbok the entrance fee would be free.  D',\n",

We were here during the Lunar New Year so there were many people in traditional dress taking pictures and it made you feel like you had gone back in time. I think even in wintertime when the plants are not in bloom it is still nice to see the palace grounds. Put this site on the top of your list when you come to Seoul.',\n",

This is the village we walk wearing the Hanbok  it was my firts time to wear a Hanbok so I didn t know there are sizes I just choose the color I want and the designed i want I know its gown so its okay to be long all i know the photo taking is indoor only but when we started walking down along the street crossing the road and going around the village for some orientation and briefing and photo taking  I can t wven imagine I can wear a gown walking for almost 1 hour in autumn seasom...hahaha and even realized how to go toilette when wearing a gown like that...hmmm...quite interesting!!!!',\n",

Simply marvelous seeing the architecture. Can get a little crowded and plenty of tourists standing by and sitting on perfect photo ops which can get annoying. But if you have the time its definitely worth it to visit this palace!',\n",
       " ' Ok to visit We kept our visit of Changdeokgung Palace rather short since there is not much to see. The buildings are scattered in a rather large area. There are no detailed explanations about the life in the palace and the purpose of the different buildings. The gardens are pretty unkempt. Been there done that. If you re nearby have a look.',\n",
       " ' Awesome palace! This is a must see if you re in Seoul. We were lucky to visit during the holiday and got to see a special demonstration as well. ',\n",
       " ' Bustling grounds The entire site is a modern rebuild of a palace that once stood on this site. It s a shame  because clearly the original must have been very spectacular. The rebuild is interesting enough  but you cannot enter any of the buildings at all and those that have their doors open  and that s not very many  have little to see inside. It s also very busy with noisy tour groups and school children. Regardless  it s not to be missed. Buy the Royal Palace Pass for W10 000 as it s a BIG saving on the six sites it includes. The Secret Garden is a separate tour  but is actually more interesting than the palace  but you can only visit the garden if you visit the palace too. The Pass package includes both.',\n",

The palace has many entries and it was in in city which was good. The structural of the buildings were in good condition and very details  even there were lots of small allies that unable to enter but did not cut the fun to take selfies and pictures. The secret garden was so exclusive but need abit of walking up and down  after all not too bad because the tour guide was in slow pace allowing guests to walk slowly to see  look around and experience. The structural of those buildings were in good form and able to know how the King relaxed  the views of those big lotus ponds  trees  water and breezes..which was good experience.',\n",

The Secret Garden may only be accessed  however  by joining a group tour organized by palace management. Better check on the tour schedules. I didn t bother and got stuck with the Korean tour group. I have zero Korean language background aside from the usual hi  bye  and thanks. So  I couldn t really appreciate any information from the tour as it wasn t in English. Aside from the Secret Gardens  what makes this palace unique is the collection of reconstructed imperial government offices in the grounds. It is a maze in that area. Picture perfect opportunities also if you have your traditional Korean costume on. Now  if only it wasn t raining heavily when I was there... ',\n",
       " ' Getting know Korean History It s a big complex area. They have museum inside the complex.

You can also walk around this palace using Hanbok traditional korean outfit  I think they are gorgeous. ',\n",

We booked a secret garden tour online  book well in advance  and it was worth it. The garden is really the most authentic part of the old palace.',\n",
       " ' Great English guided tours. We came to explore the secret gardens which were beautiful as the leaves were changing colour. We joined a free English guided tour which was really informative. The guide was full of enthusiasm and gave us lots of history and stories about the garden. He did a Palace tour later in the day so we stayed for that too which was just as good although a little shorter. It s a beautiful palace  well maintained in nice grounds. The secret garden is the highlight. ',\n",

It s also next to another temple and surrounded by a wooded area making it really pretty. In that same area there is also the secret garden that you can see. Nearby the shopping and not too far from gunbokgung temple as well.',\n",

       " ' UNESCO World Heritage Site   Changdeokgung Palace is awe inspiring! We had a beautiful morning for our visit to Changdeokgung Palace  all the better to take it in at an unhurried pace. Changdeokgung was originally built as a secondary to the main  Gyeongbokgung Palace  which I have toured on several previous occasions. The main difference about Changdeokgung Palace is that it was built with the full intention of integrating it into its natural surroundings. So while the buildings may appear strange  they are intended to harmonize with the topography according to  pungsu principles . The palace structures are all situated to the south  with the immense  Secret Garden  at the rear and to the north. Although the original buildings of Changdeokgung were destroyed by fire  the reconstruction are said to retain a high degree of authenticity. Anyway you look at it  it s immense and gorgeous! You do have to hit the timing right to visit the Secret Garden  w  purchase of a separate ticket   as tour groups go at different times  in different languages. A charming new tradition we noticed is that many shops nearby the palace offer Hanbok  traditional dress  rental. Many groups of beautiful  young  mostly Japanese  it seemed  women were everywhere in Hanbok and pretty  flower laced  hair do s  happily taking selfies. We thought them all quite adorable and a nice addition to the feeling of stepping back into a page in history!',\n",
       " ' A Highlight of Seoul An UNESCO World Heritage Site  built during the Joseon Dynasty in 1405  Changdeokgung Palace is both a highlight of Seoul and a must on any history lovers itinerary. The gardens are beautiful with mature  think 300 year old  trees. The palace itself is historical and a good look at Korean architecture from that era. I love how the palace compounds blends so well with the surrounding nature. Recommended.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden in Changdeokgung?!? Not much different than the first palace except for its  Secret Garden . I am sure that this garden is lovely but between the frozen ponds  barren trees and lack of all color except for brown and white  it was somewhat hard to imagine. Hope to see yourself..',\n",
       " ' Nice Palace to see A lot of old architecture to see if you appreciate the history  every pillar on roof comes with a FORK alike item that is to prevent bird from nesting around  such a intelligent design since old korea age',\n",
       " ' UNESCO World Heritage and Secret Garden The highlight for me aside from the rich architecture was the secret garden tour. I actually went back three times on the same day for it because I kept missing the time or the available tickets. They kept telling me I m late even though I was 30 minutes early. Only thing I muttered was  But I ran all the way here from the station.  Luckily  I got to be part of the 3pm Huwon tour and it was well worth it. Changdeokgung is interconnected with another palace known as Changgyeonggung. It is located just beside the entrance for the secret garden tour. It s a small palace unlike the other ones but worth a visit if you re into history. ',\n",
       " ' Worth getting the free tour We just so happened to catch the free English tour of the palace and were glad we did. Our tour guide was fantastic and it was a pleasure to learn about the history. We then followed this with a tour of the secret garden. The garden was very nice to see  but not particularly spectacular. You have to have a guided tour and there were a lot of people when we were there which made it a bit tricky to hear  plus we had to keep stopping to wait for everyone to catch up   take photos etc which made it quite a long tour. Overall it was worth it though.',\n",

Ensure you get to see both. The English language guide for the secret garden was very good  almost 90 mins tour . If you have time there is the Changgyeonggung Palace adjacent and reached by an inter connecting gate.',\n",
       " ' Group Tour This palace is less crowded than some  is well restored and interesting. But the big attraction is the Secret Garden  which is hardly secret but is a gem. Very hard to remember you are in the heart of downtown Seoul when inside. Don t miss it!',\n",
       " ' Historical site   but are my dogs tired Very interesting site  much of it purposefully left unrestored. Large site  the tour guide stated the grounds covered 110 acres. Make sure you have comfy shoes and are prepared for a lot of walking. If you take to Secret Garden tour  be prepared for some fairly steep grades. It s definitely not for mobility challenged individuals. One of the members on the tour dragged around luggage for the entire tour. If you take luggage to the tour  do yourself and others the courtesy of storing your bags in a locker at a subway or rail station before you go here.',\n",

But this palace has something that draws you in the moment you step in the secret garden  you have to take a tour for this . My guide is amazing and you can almost imagine the royalties walking the path towards the secret garden for some R and R.

It s a great place to check out the history of Korea and immerse yourself in the Korean culture. It s so much fun to dress up with your friends and take pictures.

It s a guided tour that takes about an hour ands half. It s quite a bit of walking so make sure you re up for it. Overall  the palace was nice and the grounds were very scenic. For me most of the palaces in Seoul are very similar to each other and that includes this one too. ',\n",

Once I finished I looked back at the site and there were 0 remaining spots so they go quick! Once you arrive you have to show the reservation and actually buy the ticket. If you plan to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace as well  but the Integrated ticket instead and save 1000 or more. The tour is normally 90min long but they are doing a trial and allowing you to just walk on your own. Had I known this I wouldnt have bothered with the english tour and picked a better time.

The palaces are very well preserved and the gardens are just beautiful. Every day at 3 00 and 4 30 pm there is a tour of the Secret Garden which you cannot enter on your own. We did the tour and you get to see a big area of the complex otherwise not accessible to visitors. It s free of charge if you buy the booklet with access to this palace and Gyeongbokgung. ',\n",

There was only a small cafe refreshments area  especially relevant for us as it was a bright hot day. There are so many photo opportunities  any amateur photographer will be more than satisfied.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden Went on a guided tour here and I felt it helps to better understand and enjoy the sights in Changdeokgung. It was less crowded than Gyeongbokgung when I was there. Nice to put on hanbok and take colourful photos!  By the way  admission was free since we wore hanbok! ',\n",
       " ' Stunning This is my college roommate s favorite palace  so this is the sole palace I visited. I especially loved watching the girls  mostly  in traditional hanbok taking selfies and photo shoots. I was able to witness the changing of the guard  and partook in the tea and traditional sweets in the Sujong room. Admittedly the tea and sweets were approximately  25  and I didn t get my money s worth  but it s for the experience and I have no regrets. The grounds were gorgeous and went on and on. There were musicians playing in the background and I couldn t resist take part of getting my photo taken in a hanbok on a regal throne as it was free for tourists.',\n",

Took us about 4 hours to tour the palace. Much longer than I anticipated. Many tourists dressed in hanbok. Wear comfortable shoes because the palace is huge and lots of walking. Pack a water bottle because it s hot.',\n",

       " ' Smaller palace near to Namsan park Came here to have a look at the palace and especially  the guard changing ceremony. Located quite near City Hall metro station. Guard changing at 11am and lasted just a short while before the whole ceremony repeats again. There is a small booth for a quick free hanbok rental that allows you 3 mins to put on for photoshoot. The palace itself is not that big. If you just want to see the guard changing ceremony  just come to the outside of the palace as you do not need entrance ticket for it. Interesting to see the guard changing ceremony though.',\n",

       " ' Visiting with friends We walk here from City Hall where we were staying. The main entrance is now opened as I remember that it was under reconstruction then. There were guards doing sentry duties and they attracted much photo session. I was delighted to be granted free access being a  Senior Citizen . It s the usual visual to see how royalty live in the past. Lots of ground to cover as the site is huge. Highlight for me is to see a lot of folks wearing traditional Korean costume. And many were foreigners renting and wearing them. I said hello to a group of students from Indonesia dressed in the hanboks. I greet them in Bahasa which surprised them. ',\n",
       " ' Book the Secret Garden tour! The palace is nice but in my opinion the Secret Garden is the highlight. Unfortunately you can only visit it as part of tour but it s worth it.',\n",
       " ' Immense and beautiful. I didn t even see the entire palace  because it is enormous. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to do a lot of walking. The architecture is simply a wow  and the restoration work keeps the vibrancy alive. Two things that stood out  the portrait gallery with it s haunting lack of portraits  one can only imagine!   and the wonderful trees they have gone to some pains to keep. The trees alone were worth going to see.  Yeah  I m weird that way.  ',\n",

       " ' Great historical land mark We went to see this palace built during Joseon dynasty and the palace was a reminder of great design work at that time. You need to go to Anguk station exit 3 and walk about 450 to 500 m  please follow the sign to find this palace',\n",
       " ' OK Wanted to visit gyeongbokgung but it was closed on a tuesday  so we settled for this instead. Free admission if you wear Hanbok. Not as pretty as Gyeongbokgung in my opinion and after awhile every part looks the same. Nevertheless  we still took some pretty photos in our hanbok.',\n",
       " ' Stunning well preserved example Beautiful  very interesting and so well preserved! I spent several hours here  despite the severe June heat and humidity and was absolutely fascinated by the history of the palace   highly recomended',\n",
       " ' Tiring! We went for the 10 30am Secret Garden tour on a hot June day. We find the tour a bit slow for our pace. The garden itself was alright. However  we find that the morning noon sun was quite draining. And there were some uphill and downhill that we need to climb. It might be difficult  if not impossible for people who have mobility problems. The garden itself and the scenery was very nice  but after touring the garden for 1.5 hours  we were not so keen to look at the palace anymore  as we have seen the bigger one the day before . Overall  I would recommend this for those who likes to look at architecture and learn about history. But probably it won t be very interesting for young kids.',\n",
       " ' Interesting but lacking I went later in the day so I missed the last Secret Garden tour gog foreigners  it turns out you re not allowed on your own and in my opinion without the secret garden it s good but not great. The gift shop had some great items at very low cost!',\n",
       " ' A pleasant escape inside the metropolis Changdeokgung is conveniently located close to downtown Seoul  just a short walk from Insadong. If you re only going to visit one palace in Seoul  I suggest Gyeongbokgung since there s more to see but Changdeokgung is also a very nice place to escape the hurried athmosphere of the city. If you re planning to visit the secret garden  make sure to reserve in advance and check the timetable for tours. Admission to the palace is separate and only costs somewhere around 1000 won per person.',\n",
       " ' Nice walk and relax It s nice place clean and so peaceful and beautiful garden to walk can be romantic as well many young people s hangout in weekend and wear Korea customized outfits they look so beautiful too been here many times but still love it ',\n",
       " ' Worth booking the secret garden tour It is worth booking ahead to do the secret garden palace tour. As has been mentioned in other reviews  it s a relatively hilly landscape so I noticed that older attendees didn t complete all of the walk. The palace is large and pretty and the gardens lovely  it was just approaching cherry blossom season when I visited . It was nice to get some context the tour itself lasted around 90 minutes and the guide was very good. The tour comprised a very large group but given the vastness of the gardens  the crowd did not overwhelm. Afterwards  enjoy a cup of local tea at one of the cafes and take in the surroundings. Lots of people visit fully clad in traditional outfits  so it is worth taking a moment to people watch and appreciate the traditional vibes.  I believe there is a discount for entry   it is free if people dress up! ',\n",
       " ' Not much to see My mother and I did a secret garden tool of the palace. It was not that great. The tour was in Chinese since my mother only speaks chinese. It was a free tour offered by the park. The group was about 30 people with some family with young children and seniors. The tourist guide was not good at all. Her Chinese was not clear  so most of the time we could not understand her. The garden itself is also not what we expected. It s not a botanic garden with flowers and plants  rather it s a big wooded area with natural trees on hills up and down. There were few residence halls here and there. So really not much to see. The guide walked very fast and never bother to check on anybody. It was like a hiking trip with climbing up and downs. The last draw was that the guide lead the group to an almost vertical up stairs in the bushes and just went up without asking anybody if they could do it. I would not risk my mother breakkng her leg gojng up there. So  with some other families with young children we had to look around to find another way out. It was totally unprofessional! We went to see other parts of the palace and didn t find the impressive. All the big halls have tall stairs to climb  so not easy for elderly. I don t recommend the secret garden tool. Especially if you are not fit for hiking.',\n",
       " ' The secrete garden tour was interesting!! We went to see the secret garden English tour which took about 90 minuets. There were about 50 people together. A guide was explaining about each spots in the garden and it was very interesting!! It was such a bloody hot day so it s better to bring some water with you if you visit in summer!! The garden paths are up and down  so it s better to wear comfortable shoes!! spots shoes are better ',\n",
       " ' Unworthy Tour of the Secret Garden Entrance to the Changdeokgung Palace costed 3000 wons  but the Secret Garden could only be admitted by joining a 5 000 won tour at the entrance. Tourists are only allowed to tour the garden with the Guide. We visited in July and joined a Chinese tour at 12 30pm. The Garden is not big and with just a few buildings attractions inside  many of which did not allow entry. The tour can be completed within 30 minutes. However  the guide prolonged the tour to more than one hour. It was very hot on a summer day with lots of mosiquitos  and no fun to stand in front of a lily pond for 20 minutes listening to the guide chatting with tourists on topics unrelated to the palace or the garden. In fact  relevant historical information provided was minimal. The tour ended up being a boring torture and I would advise skipping it.',\n",
       " ' My favorite of the palaces in Seoul The style of Korean Palace architecture and beautifully painted exteriors really appears to me and this one was my favorite of those I visited. I especially liked the  secret garden  acessed by paying an additional fee and waiting to the appointed time to be led through by a guide. Despite the crowd herded through this way the extensive gardens  pavilions  lakes and so on were beautiful and worth the extra time and expense. It is very hilly with lots of steps so you may want to think twice is you have physical limitations. ',\n",
       " ' Korean Heritage Well restored palace structures and a real sense of history palpable throughout the grounds of the site. Wife and daughter rented Hanboks nearby and toured the area while being photographed. Highly recommended destination for all travelers while in country.',\n",
       " ' Traditional Korean architecture   nice for a morning walk Not to big  but a nice park for a morning walk to see traditional Korean architecture and to learn some history. Less crowded than the Gyeongbokgung Palace and it is great with combination to visit the Bukchon area. If you rent a Hanbok  you get the entrance for free. Be prepared to meet a lot of girls in traditional clothes  especially in the weekends You have to pay extra to visit the Secret garden.',\n",
       " ' The best of the palaces So I visited all the palaces and shrines that are included in the pass you can buy for a slight discount  you can get it at any of them at the entrance gate . if you are limited on time this is the best one to visit. There is another palace right next to it but it is a separate entrance fee so you can easily hit up two of them. The additional charge for the secret garden is worth it  especially if you go in the summer to get some shade! It is located in an area that has lots of other sites as well.',\n",

       " ' Nice Place Worth having a look at. Not a lot to see. You can buy a ticket which allows you entrance to all the palaces here. The main attraction is the secret garden. Not really what I would call a garden but a walk through a forest with a guide which was quite interesting.',\n",
       " ' Palace with garden This palace isn t too crowded and the best compared to others. The main attraction is secret garden. You may pay extra to entry the secret garden. You can entry secret garden only if you join the tour that are provided in this palace. You may book the tour one befoe  online thru changdeokgung s website.

But I had nothing to do in the morning when most of the shops are not opened at 9am. The entrance fee is just a few bucks so when u visit this palace with high expectations  u lose nothing but just time. Just go in and have a feel of the korean palaces. At least when u visit one  u feel the connection when you watch korean dramas.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden needs a guide The Palace itself is nice  though similar to others. The entrance fee is cheap. If you want to visit the secret garden you should know that it is a guided tour that will take 1 2 hours  but I am not sure when the tours start. I do know there is one at 2 30pm. But other than that I am not sure  perhaps they are every half hour or hour  I don t know  we did not have enough time as we were headed back to our hotel to catch the bus to the airport  so we didn t get to visit. There is also another palace you need to pay for inside  also not expensive  it needs about an hour  I think we went inside there  walked to the other entrance and then walked to get something to eat. It is a nice walk through the area The rest of the palace is interesting  if you have some extra time and not sure where to go  I think it is worth seeing.',\n",
       " ' the most liveable looking Seoul palaces In contrast with the more formal Gyeongbokgung  Changdeokgung looks like a pleasant place to live  especially with its extensive attached secret garden. The casual visitor may only see a collection of buildings  but each closer look reveals new touches  as if peeling an onion... Walking through the grounds  one will at times catch a particularly harmonious fleeting glimpse  be it an alignment of roofs  a mountain through a small gate  a wall accommodating a tree  etc. The large number of healthy looking birds further confirms that this is one of the nicest green spots in Seoul    Attached is a picture of the schedule of the various guided tours in their respective languages. My English speaking guide spoke unaccented colloquial US English. Be warned that the secret garden tour is arduous for elderly people  as the footpath includes some uneven stone stairs  and the tour is almost 2 hours in length  with few opportunities to sit.',\n",

However  it s a good mock up to know the history of Korea. A small palace  not really too much to see. King s life looks boring. ',\n",

No regret if you cannot enter the Secret Garden due to full booking in summer. Landscape and scenery are nothing special there. It was very humid in July when I went there. But I believe its scenery would be very beautiful when maples blossom in fall. In general  the buildings of Changdeokgung Palace outside Secret Garden are much better than those in Gyeongbokgung Palace.',\n",

Are the ancient Koreans sitting around in an empty room all the time? I m not sure  but the experience could of been greatly enhanced if the buildings actually have things in it for people to get a glimpse of life of ancient Korean royalty. Finally  the main palace within this palace the front door that you can see the emperor s throne was blocked off for  Korean language tour only . So if you re a foreigner you re NOT allowed to get the best view to see inside the palace. The only reason this is a 4 star and not a 5 star.',\n",

The garden is only accessed via guided tours  which is understandable in a way  since you don t want visitors picking flowers or dabbling their feet in the pools  but it does take away some of the charm of this garden.

Some of the trees were blossoming which gave it a more picturesque aura. When we tried to go to the Secret Garden we realised we can only visit with a tour. So be aware that you may have to wait for the next tour to get in. The tour took 1h30m. If you are into tours than by all means wait and go. I did and sincerely regretted it.

Changdeokgung is massive palace  but maybe not as big as Gyeongbokgung.

So I didn t get much around the palace itself. We straight to secret garden entrace  and thank god the guide wasn t there yet. after the guide arrived we enter the secret garden. don t worry the guide was speaking english  also there is a chinese tour for certain time. the guide told us that Secret Garden can only be enter by the king himself  other people can enter this side of the palace only by king permission. so its truly a privileges for us to enter this secret garden. the garden is very much preservative and I can see why you can only enter in certain time and with personal guide. Its like went inside another world  its not like seoul.. when you enter you can only feel peace. the air is different  even though the city just right upon you. I just want to stay there as long as I could. But I could not because the guide only give us 10 15 minutes spare time for each site we visit. wear a nice and comfy shoes because the walk can take for 1 1 5 hours. and there quite few hills. my friend just went under surgeries last month and can t take the hills very well. security guard was nice and keeping her a company when we continue our tour. for me if you visit seoul and have extra time. do visit this palace and secret garden for certain.',\n",

The secret gardens can only be visited by guided tour and these seem to be very popular and sell out quickly. There is another entrance to a palace for an additional fee too close to the secret garden entrance. People can access the palace grounds for free if they get dressed up in traditional clothes',\n",
       " ' Beautiful but a lot of walking to do in Huwon I nearly thought I had to skip the secret garden as I missed the online booking  only fifty slots per time slot per language per day. You can not enter without buying the tour tickets. But I read that they have fifty tickets on sale on that day as well so we went before opening to queue and managed to get tickets. I would advise getting the integrated palace pass as it is more worthwhile for visiting all the palaces and Jongmyo. As long as you take the guided tour it wouldn t seem like a blur of palaces. Each one had its unique features and place in history. In spring the flowers are lovely and the architecture layout here I feel is the best of the palaces. It is a lot of walking for old folks to do and a bit of uphill and downhill especially at the last leg of the Huwon tour  so wear good walking shoes. The guide does give breaks at each point though and there is a toilet inside. The cafe and souvenir shop in the palace grounds is really nice do check it out. No food served though.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace and gardens Walking round the palace is wonderful  although very busy at the weekend. The highlight was the secre5 garden  which has limited tickets on sale each day.

You could get a local tour to explain the histories of the palaces if you fancy history and would like to know the differences  otherwise you could just read from the writings throughout the different section of the palace. We enjoy quiet walk by ourselves and admiring the architecture so we did not engage with one. ',\n",

Reasons  1. mostly not as crowded 2. Wonderful garden  especially in autumn and spring   In summer more shade then Gyeongbokgung! 3. A bit closer to the part of the city with traditional houses and many neat coffee shops. 4. Closer to Insadong 5. Closer to Jongmyo Shrine 6. Neighbouring Changgyeong palace is worth a visit  too. In summer there are night tours through the beautifully lit up premises. You need to reserve tickets beforehand! What you should do at Gyeongbokgung however is to watch the change of the guards. However you would not need to pay any entrance fee to do so. Enjoy your stay!',\n",

Magnificent place for details different from one in Beijing with color   green  and that there is more nature inside. The best thing was the guard change  it happens .. every day 2 times I tell you times soon They follow traditional ceremony that tells loads about local ways. Times  Small one  10 00 and 12 00 Big one 11 00 and 14 00 Cost incide is 3000 won .... but if you wears traditional outfit you can walk in for free. So better find a shop and dress like local for a day.',\n",

I ve heard its free entrance or something if tourist wears that.. but not 100  sure.',\n",

The palace is nice to walk around  would suggest waalking shoes as the paths are cobbled or sandy. It is quite impressive and still in good condition. Grounds are huge and backs onto the mountains. Very nice.',\n",

I also rented the sudio tour but the live  free  tour was so much better. Given that it was weekday  the group was not huge  30?  and the guide was really great at making sure we all kept up and heard what she told us aboutt he palace  the symbolism and the lives of the Korean royals.

The palaces looked similar on the outside but the decorations here were a bit more colourful. This place also has tours to the secret garden  the tickets are extra to the entrance ticket and located near the entrance of the garden. We had just missed the last English one for the day so decided to go to the next place instead.',\n",

       " ' A bit overrated I think if you have done much travelling in Asia this site may not live up to expectations. Yes  the grounds are huge but there isn t really a lot to see. There are very few building that are open  and most that are aren t terribly ornate. You walk around and look at the exterior of the building with the doors all closed and all the mini complexes have the same architecture. It becomes rather repetitive. I don t feel like you need to spend too much exploring every corner of the palace  hit the highlights and move on. The Folk Museum you can access for free is probably the best part  very informative on Korean culture. Keep you ticket stub for re entry to the palace grounds. ',\n",
       " ' Lovely cherry blossoms in early April The Changdeokgung Palace is very popular in late March  early April as the cherry blossoms flourish. The most popular spot is in front of the Secret Garden entrance where visitors pose for photos. The palace is easy to go. I usually walk from Insa dong to the palace within half an hour. From the palace one could walk into Changgyeonggung  there is an entrance to it just behind the small Secret Garden ticket office.',\n",

       " ' My favourite palace in Seoul Ok so you will probably end up at Gyeongbokgung since it s the  main  palace. But once inside  it s nice  not great. Changdeokgung is without a doubt the better of the two. Most friends and family who come to Korea also agree. It s not symmetric  but it s a lot more peaceful  and there are many hidden spots without people  even on crowded days. The secret garden at the back is worth visiting  but you need to book this at the ticket office and English tours only run several times a day  check their official site for times.',\n",
       " ' Fun day out! I think if you visit Seoul  you have to go to one of the palaces. We went on a busy  sunny  weekend and it was very enjoyable. There s lots of places to walk around  and it s much different from the palaces and castles back home. Rent a hanbok!!! There re loads of places nearby  very reasonably priced  and it makes the whole experience more fun. Also  free entry if you do so. Whilst here we were approached by people  I want to say high school students?  who asked us to vote on things we liked about Korea. No idea why they were doing this  but it was fun to speak to new people. Also a lot of people taking pictures for each other.',\n",

But the main reason I came here was the Secret Garden tour and we were not disappointed. The tour itself provides valuable information for those interested in the history of the place. I stayed back for the first few buildings  then decided to explore on my own  since I wanted to get nice pictures without the whole group in them  the tour is limited to 100 people . I would recommend that. You can always go back and catch up with the group  or ask the guide some questions. The gardens are so beautiful  we were lucky with the weather  sunshine and blue sky.

The secret garden does involve a hill climb that is short but not suitable for anyone on crutches or in a wheelchair or with breathing difficulties  however if the guide is informed they will take an alternative route.

It is the palace where the last remaining members of the Korean monarchy lived until the 1980s.

Although the infrastructure of most of the buildings within the palace are not original as the original palace was destroyed during a fire  the new structures  still pretty old since it was rebuild in the 1700s to 1800s  are magnificent. I absolutely love the colours and design of the rooftops of the buildings within this palace. There is also the secret garden which is really beautiful and perfect for Instagram and offers you an insight of the life of the Korean monarchy. recommended to join the free tours that is provided  subjected to different timings for Korean  Chinese  Japanese and English .

       " ' Nice Palace The palace was nice and was interesting. Not sure if they do it everyday  but while we were there  a lot of people dressed in historic local attire  both male and female  were there and it was very neat. Very friendly people and willing to take pictures with the tourists without having to pay. When they close  they close and they have several people rounding up slow moving people pushing them toward the door..so don t plan to get there late and overstay.',\n",

       " ' Definitely go for the guided tour This lacks the grandeur of Gyeongbukgung but I liked the serene feel of this palace  especially if you go for the Suwon. The area open to public is quite small  as majority of the land is within the secret garden tour. Actually  you can t explore the whole place even with the secret garden tour but it was worth the extra pay.',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Palace Although this is a  secondary  palace it is no less of a  must see  destination in Seoul. There is a beautiful park towards the back part of the palace grounds that is wonderful for walking.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden and Changdeokgung Palace Yes really similar to Gyeongbokgung palace but still nice to see and walk around. I also booked a tour to the secret garden  I booked it 4 days in advance  but I wouldn t recommend it in winter or early march april. We had a lovely english tour guide but the secret garden is nothing I haven t seen before and it can be hard for some people to walk up the steep hill. I would only go back to the secret garden in autumn other than that I would skip it to be honest.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden Tour with friendly tour guide 2nd visit to this palace. But 1st time going for the Secret Garden tour. Just have to do online reservation in 1 week advance for which language the tour would be conducted in. Reach the palace at least 20 mins before tour starts to secure booking. Went during Spring time  and trees look bare. Scenery would have been beautiful in Autumn. Secret Garden tour took around 1.5 hours to finish and there are up down slopes to take on which might be tricky for elderly. It s still manageable to walk at your own pace  just that will be missing out on the introduction of the corners. Friendly tour guide are more than willing to share and answer queries which you might have for the sites. Would love to be back during Autumn!',\n",

The garden was so beautiful  words fail to describe its beauty  so here are some pictures. ',\n",
       " ' One of the must see sights in Seoul The palace is one of the sights you need to see if you visit Seoul. It s historic and evocative  although the actual building interiors and surroundings are a bit austere and lifeless  as opposed to a more full functioning actual monastery. The buildings themselves have been very nicely restored  however  and the grounds are impressive. Since the palace is right downtown it is easily accessible by subway  downtown hotels  etc. Seeing only this sight palace  as opposed to something more current and vibrant for the modern population would be a mistake  but if you have a few hours this is the kind of place that gives a sense for the history of Korea. It is also possible to rent traditional costumes nearby which can lend a novel flavor to your trip  and your photos  so long as you are willing to play the part and simultaneously feel a bit ridiculous.',\n",
       " ' The Best Palace Tour by Far Changdoekgung is by far the best preserved palace in Seoul. While Gyeongbukgung is more famous  it has been altered more. I suggest you take the English speaking tour for your 1st visit  there are usually 2 or more a day. The tour takes you through the grounds and into a couple of the buildings  but more importantly takes you too the Hidden Gardens  ponds  and summer retreat palace buildings. Korean landscaping is much more natural than other gardens. If you only have a couple days in Seoul  I put this high on the list of places to go. It is in central Seoul and close to Gyeongboekgung  Insadong  City Hall  Myeongdong  and Namdaenum. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Garden and palace The palace is lovely but the highlight is the secret garden. You need to join a guided tour  which isn t something we usually do  but the tour guide was interesting and easy to understand. We reserved our places on line  which was easy to do and can be done up to 6 days in advance. Tours in English are at 10.30  11.30  2.30 and 3.30. You do need to allow yourself 15 20 mins to walk from the main entrance gate to the start of the tour. If you are planning to visit the garden then you really should buy a combination ticket. This cost W10 000  less than 7  and includes entrance to the secret garden as well as entrance to four palaces and the royal shrine. Given that Changdeokgung Palace and Garden costs W8 000 together  the combo ticket is excellent value. You need to take your reservation details to the main ticket office to exchange it for a secret garden ticket before entering the palace.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace You really shouldn t miss the lovely Changdeokgung palace in Seoul  one of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. The buildings are wonderful  colorful and impressive  but the highlight of my visit to the palace grounds was no doubt the guided walk through the Secret Garden. Make sure to include this in your visit! The guide was very knowledgeable and spoke excellent English. I visited the gardens in early March  but would love to go back in spring  summer or fall to enjoy the changing colors of the beautiful trees and flowers. Must be quite a sight! Highly recommended. A must visit when in Seoul.',\n",

We would have had a great time enjoying the sites with a regular guide but our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the site  she used to work there  and the colour and history she added really makes all the difference in understanding the structure  the design and history including impacts of the Japanese occupation   don t cut your experience short  a good tour guide really makes all the difference.',\n",

Actually I considered to visit Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung just befort a day of visit. But I m sure Changdeokgung is better because I ve heard several comments about Gyeonbokgung that there are too much people to enjoy that place. However Changdeokgung is good enough to enjoy the gung with nice weather  beautiful building and so on. And I recommend to use an application the  Real  Changdeokgung  which guides you based on your location. It is very helpful to tour Changdeokgung. Alwasy it s true that  Your knowledge determines your insight.  At that point  it was awesome and to wonderful application to visit Changdeokgung.',\n",

To visit required to two tickets or you can get a ticket for W 10 000 which allows visits to other palaces. The palace is a UNESCO heritage sight. However the walk in the Secret Garden was lovely   a bit of an oasis in the middle of Seoul. It would have been even nicer in earlier spring or fall as the leaves would be lovely. A nice way to get a bit of exercise. ',\n",

Our rental was only for 2 hours  so we decided to hurriedly explore the palace. When wearing hanbok  the entrance fee to the palace is FREE! It s better to come early to the palace ground to beat the crowd! I didn t get time to enter the famous secret garden  but i believe it s beautiful. The palace ground itself is really beautiful. Showing the grand and elegance of the Jeoson dynasty. Some of the king s collections can be seen. Also  we can see interesting side of an actual weatern bed that the king used at the end of the japanese occupation in Korea.',\n",

You pay a little more but you get treated to some  secret spots  that are normally not accessible with the regular entrance ticket. We went early to queue for the English tour at 10 30 on a Sunday. Or you can reserve on their website a week before visiting and just pay upon pick up. ',\n",
       " ' Easily accessible from Angus station. Worth a visit! The secret garden should be more interesting during the fall ! The different types of trees would certainly be a feast for the eyes! Foliage was all green only when I visited. The entrance fee was 3 000 won  and there is a separate charge to enter the secret garden  5000 won  It would be nice to get 1 or 2 k won discount if buy it together though! The palace itself is interesting as the orientation differs from most other palaces. Changyunggung can be accessed inside the palace. Entrance of 1000 won can be purchased at gate  and with proof of the changdeokgung ticket stub  can re enter from the same place . Worth to do it together .',\n",
       " ' Visit the Secret Garden This palace is beautiful and it is a more manageable size. It was a quiet day in October when I visited and the Secret Garden tour made it more special. English tours are available and they sold out fast  so plan the trip in advance. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and patient  gave everybody an opportunity to ask question and take pictures. It was beautiful and also a bit sad to see the pound in the format of the unified Koreas  South and North  and makes you wish that one day they become the same country again. It is a lot of walking up and downhill and the tour ends in a place where you need to climb uneven stairs but it is manageable',\n",

The tours are only at set times so make you check out the times before you go. The palace itself and the picturesque gardens really give you a good idea of the lifestyle and culture of the people that once lived there. You might also see many Korean couples dress in the traditional attire  hanbok   walking around posing for photos. It s a common Korean couple activity as well as for wedding photos.',\n",
       " ' A Must See Got here just in time to roam around the outside of the palace and see the displays of the old tools and homes. The place is very nice. We did not go in to the museum but you get to learn a lot of the heritage from the outside too. Must witness the changing of the guard which we caught at 1pm.',\n",

Plus we had the benefit of a superb display by the many guards in a multiplicity of colours completing some form of historic routine which lasted over one hour. 100 s of school kids were sitting down in attendance and enjoying the glorious display by so many. We then received free entry as Seniors to The Palace and we enjoyed the Palace buildings that were restored in 1834   after a number of fires had mostly destroyed the original buildings which had commenced in 1484. During the Japanese occupation the Palace name was changed to   Changgyeongwon and in 1986 the South Korean Government restored The Palace to its original state and changed its name back to   Changgyeonggung Palace. More young and older ladies in costume and lots of photos opportunities with the beautiful flowers   including lots of Cherry Blossoms. A great place to visit and is highly recommended ',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden Tour. went there specifically for the renowned Secret Garden sights end of March  the cherry blossom season. You gotta pay extra for this Secret Garden guided tour  as they wont let you in by yourself. otherwise you just pay for the general admission fee. Seem wearing a Hanbok will get you some discount on the entrance fee. the old heritage building is well maintained and upon entering we were greeted by 2 blooming white cherry blossom tree. there were a few more pink cherry blossom further in. as for the Secret Garden tour  very informative tour guide and very friendly. there are different language tour session  so know when is preferred time slots. Was a disappointed though with the scenery as the flowers are not in bloom and the trees are still withered from winter. Be prepared for a little up slope hike. Really choose your visiting season well or else be disappointed. Tour guide recommend to visit during full blown spring  authumn and winter  with snow covering the land  to enjoy the place true beauty. perhaps 1 day will revisit again.',\n",

There is a package deal for KW 10 000 for 4 or 5 palaces including a 70 minute guided tour of the Secret Garden at Changdeokgung  this is a must for those interested in its history. You can purchase the package at any of the palaces ticket offices. The guided tour is informative and you will be given time for photos and a short break. You won t regret it! For those of you interested in Seoul s history  stop by the Seoul Museum of history first  it ll give you a good background of the city.',\n",

       " ' Secret Garden is a must see Smaller and quieter than the other palaces. We were travelling on our own and had booked tickets for the secret garden tour online. This was truly one of the highlights of our trip. You don t have to be very fit to join the 1 hour walking tour but they do expect you to stay in the group and not wander off during the tour.',\n",

This was located by a main road in the city so it was easy to access. The place is not crowded  very spacious inside and will provide you with a lot of understanding about the Buddhist way of life. This good be done through a tour guide who can provide valuable insights as you visit one site to another.',\n",

The main attraction is Huwon  better known as Secret Garden  but more appropriately known as a the Rear Back Garden . It is difficult to plan efficiently for this trip as the English guided tour would clash with the Huwon tour. I had the Huwon tour followed by a self guided walk through the remaining palace compound. You should be a able to cover this within half a day. After the trip  it would be nice to take a stroll at the nearby Bukchon to see traditional Korean houses. Stop by one of the hill top teahouses to warm up and charge your phones while enjoying tea and the evening city views. Be prepared to put on good walking shoes and to spare the remaining half of the day at this area.',\n",
       " ' A Taste of History We had a great time exploring the palace grounds with a tour guide who gave us the detailed history. The Changing of the Guard ceremony was interesting to watch   a colorful spectacle of traditional drums and march set in the main courtyard. Definitely a site to see if you visit Seoul!',\n",
       " ' A nice afternoon and walk through the garden We had an excellent afternoon including a secret garden tour. Without the tour I think it would be hard to enjoy or learn much during a visit  but the information and history provided by the guide during our 75 minute tour were really interesting and nice. Perhaps the group size was bigger than it should have been  but anyway it was a nice afternoon and without the tour it would have been a big disappointment.',\n",

       " ' Palace with its  secret garden  Not as huge and  sprawling   way to the back  as Gyeongbokgung and also not as  brightly colorful  with ceremonial guards and big guard ceremony as at Gyeongbokgung  saw no ceremonial guard whatsoever at the gate here   the  highlight  of this palace that sets it apart from all the other palaces is its so called  Secret Garden   a.k.a. Huwon  all the way at the back which is actually a  big park  with grown trees  some ponds  beautiful small pavilions   and a pretty big pavilion on a high ground which is off limits to the public  and an enclosed area with these traditional wooden row buildings forming a perimeter  guess it was like a royal resting place back in the day when they were in the garden  and also learned that the Joseon kings and queens actually took part in planting of trees and such activities  maybe as called for by the royal customs and tradition   I went in with the 12 pm Korean tour  missed my 11 am or 1130 am English tour  which took an hour and a half but it was such a  well timed and comfortable  tour with only like a 10 minute walk at most between every two stops  about six stops in total  and places to sit down at each stop  so an hour and a half went by  quite pleasantly . Another part of interest on the palace grounds is the residential area at the far end on one side  a left turn from the main pathway past the main palace building with the throne stage  or a right turn after coming out of the tour of the Secret Garden  where the last emperor of Korea and his wife after him spent their last years during the Japanese occupation. And a little  out of the way  from the rest of the Palace because it s on the other side of the main pathway from the rest of the Palace  a right turn from the main pathway just before getting to the Garden entrance  or a left turn after coming out of the Garden tour  is an enclosed area which was the place for the concubine of one of the Joseon kings. Coming by subway  Anguk Station  on Line 3  is the nearest one with just a 5 to 10 minute walk east straight on the big Yulgok ro St. to this palace. There s also the royal residence  not a palace  called Unhyeongung between the station and this palace  but you ll have to do a slight detour by turning right and walking a short distance to get there after coming out of the station . And right beside this palace is another palace called Changgyeonggung which you can actually  very conveniently  get to by going out the back exit  right beside the Secret Garden entrance  where you ll get to the high ground overlooking Changgyeonggung with stairs to go down to that palace. As for the ticket  I suggest getting an  integrated ticket  for 10 000 won which is good for a month and which covers this palace and three other palaces namely the main palace Gyeongbokgung  Changgyeonggung  right beside here as mentioned above  and Deoksugung plus Jongmyo Shrine  also just in the vicinity of this palace   and do keep in mind that this palace along with Changgyeonggung and Deoksugung are closed on Mondays and Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays.',\n",
       " ' Definitely a worthwhile visit... Changdeok Palace is one of my favorite palaces out of the 4 main palaces in Seoul because it houses the Secret Garden. While all the other buildings and corners within the Changdeok Palace premises are pretty and worth seeing  I highly recommend that any new visitors also include a walk through the Secret Garden  which require joining a tour group and paying an entrance fee of KRW 5000 per adult. The tour takes about an hour and is provided in different languages. It s a good idea to check the schedule beforehand. It is fun to hear about the history related to each of the areas within the Palace. The different pavillions are also quite fascinating to see. Also  the Palace is known to have a different look in each season  each unique and each equally worth the visit. It is also conveniently situated near the Seoul central business district.

Thanks to our private tour guide from Top Korea Tour  Juno who explained the historical part of this palace and we were like adventurers exploring the place in and out. Found a little secret locked place you can find out yourself when you are there. My mom was cooling resting at the cafe enjoying the view of trees. Totally different feeling from other palaces.

We booked the huwon garden tour  and again  the tour guide said that the garden was much more beautiful during fall. In winter  it is all snow and frozen ponds. It was nice to hear the tour guide leading us through history  though.',\n",
       " ' Increble Beautiful. It is a must! And the English guide tour was just perfect. Very detailed information and perfect english',\n",
       " ' Take the guided tours It is better to buy the Combination ticket that costs W10 000 and gives admission to 5 sites and Secret Garden. During peak seasons  it is advisable to book for guided tours via their online portal. The schedule for the guided tours are listed online for easier planning. You can also walk around the plalace ground except the Secret Garden. The guided tour of Secret Garden is highly recommended. Our tour guide was excellent in presenting the history and features of the Secret Garden.',\n",
       " ' Best palace to visit in Seoul Go on a guided tour of this palace which the Kings of Korea preferred over Gyeongbuk Palace for its feng shui. The palace was not at all crowded on a Tuesday afternoon last week. Make sure you get there early enough to visit Biwon  the Secret Garden  which closes at 4 00 pm',\n",
       " ' nice palace Walking here from Myeongdong was reasonable. There is a small admission fee to explore the grounds. We liked looking at the different buildings. The bathrooms were updated and very clean  which was surprising considering what a big tourist attraction it is.',\n",
       " ' A smaller palace that doesn t take much time We went there because it was close to the hotel. It s really pushed as breathtaking but it s not. It s a smaller version of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It s also a replica. The origami was destroyed and this was rebuilt strictly for tourists. It s buildings only  no furniture or anything else that would help you imagine what life would have been like. The good thing is that it s free for seniors. ',\n",
       " ' The BEST of the palaces. The palace has a garden inside that is so beautiful. It is only available to ticket holders who are in a group tour. It is possible to reserve tickets in adavance for the garden tour  and I highly suggest doing so since it will likely sell out. I think they offer tours in Korean  English  Chinese  and Japanese. I ve only been on the English tour  and the guides were so helpful and provided unique and interesting facts both times I ve gone. I really can t stress enough how lovely this place is. The garden tour is a bit of a walk though  and it does go up and down hills and stairs quite a bit. Just be aware that you ll walk a bit on the tour  but it s worth it.',\n",
       " ' Well preserved and restored Like the other palace  the place is well preserved and restored. I would have enjoyed myself more if there were more signages and explanation boards to indicate and describe to visitors of the various locations of the palace  since I did not join any guided tour groups. I ended up walking to places where there were just closed up rooms. Due to time constraint  I missed the Secret Garden that needed a separate ticket  probably do it on my next visit.',\n",
       " ' lovely so interesting and full of history. Cannot believe you are standing at a Palace built so long ago with such ancient traditions.',\n",
       " ' Winter views are not really as good Changdeokgung Palace is worth the visit considering that it is a UNESCO world heritage site. The temples and open spaces are not as grand as the newer Gyeongbokgung Palace  but its charm is rooted in the simplicity and humility of the structure and in the magnificent lay out of the secret garden  accessible upon payment of additional 5 000 KRW . The views of the palace and the garden  however  are not as breath taking as the views during spring or autumn. With all humility  winter views are only great if snow is thick and not yet melting. During our visit  snow is already melting  and all that s left were leafless trees and frozen ponds. Consolation comes from our tour guide who shared interesting trivia about the palace and gardens.',\n",
       " ' Royal abode While Kyeoungbok gung is a workibg quarters for the King  this place is the actual living quarters for the royal family. Much restoration has been done to correct Japanese mischief during the occupation. It s a cosy and pretty place  a palace',\n",
       " ' Beautiful to behold It is not only beautiful to behold   but even your imagination is captivated by the rich history of every structure in the Palace grounds. All the Royal Palaces are beautiful to behold ... Korea is a beautiful country with very hospitable people',\n",
       " ' Walking through the times I love history and looking at architecture. Hence  visiting the palaces in South Korea is a must. You can visit Changdeokgung  Changgyeonggung  Gyeongbokgung and Deoksugung at 10 000KRW by purchasing the combined ticket. This also includes Jongmyo shrine which I did not visit as I m not interested. Visiting in Winter is definitely cold and you won t be able to see the pretty flowers and beautiful green scenery  if you want to see those  the in house guide said spring autumn is good . But it gives another sense of imagination as the in house guide brings you around the palaces   the reality of power struggle within the palace   together with the cold winter. Architecture and the reason why certain places were built are interesting too. Definitely a must visit if you want to go deeper into the history of Korea. Of course  you won t become an expert at it but at least a good understanding if you follow through the guide or simply just download the app for each palaces and just walk through it by reading.',\n",
       " ' Beauty secret garden It long hard journey to come there by walking.. the secret garden there very beauty...scarlet heart actress are acting there... it worth to come.  many of historical evidence you may learn.. i love the tour guide explanation all about the secret garden..please come there in the 4 season..the beauty views for 4 season are different..i suggest come on spring. All flower bloom and winter also you may see the frozen lake...',\n",
       " ' Korean Palace This was our first activity in Seoul and it was a wonderful introduction into Korean history and architecture. It was raining the entire time that we were there so we did not do the secret garden. Luckily the rain did not ruin the experience of the palace.',\n",
       " ' Cant wait to visit again! This palace is much smaller than Gyeong Bok palace  but you will definately get a more out of this gem. Changdeok Palace has a garden that is only accesible through tour groups formed at the tocket booth. It is unnecessary to make reservaions if you are in a party under four  they offer walking tours in English  Chinese and Japanese. The royal garden is full of ancient trees  beautiful architecture and landscaping that is particular to the Korean culture  it is less tended and more close to a forest than a typical western garden. Don t hesitate to go on this tour as it is worth your money and time!',\n",
       " ' Beautiful The pity thing is that we came there on a cold rainy day. Anyway  we still really enjoy the beautiful peaceful scenery of Changdeokgung Palace. This place is huge  make sure to follow the guides  otherwises we will get lost. We were there in April  so there re cherry blossoms blossoming. There re many other beautiful flowers in the palace too. Great place to enjoy peace  nature and take photos.',\n",
       " ' If you need to pick a palace   come here! It s not the biggest  but in my opinion is the most beautiful! The palaces are all somewhat similar but the secret garden tour makes this one stand out from the rest. If your short on time  make this palace a priority! It may not be ask we ll known as the main palace but it is stunning! ',\n",
       " ' excelent history preserved This palace complex is a good example how Korea preservs its history. Very well conserved. Those palace are a historic mark of the glorious period of Joseon Dynasty in Korea  from 1392 to 1910. Its offer two english tours in the morning and two or three in the afternoon depends on the period of the year. For foreigners is mandatory to take the English tour.',\n",
       " ' Palace with Secret garden Really large palace  there is a secret garden but you can only visit with tour guide  dont miss it and check to tour guide time for it not expencive',\n",
       " ' Beautiful to visit in spring and summer Interesting palaces and gardens. Unfortunately in February no flowers or leaves on trees so the beauty of the gardens could not be seen. Good guides  especially my group had a very good guide for the Secret Garden tour. The Secret Garden tour is limited to groups of max 100 persons. Plenty of walking so not good for people with limited mobility. Not fun to visit on a rainy day.',\n",
       " ' Great treasure  Secret Garden was beautiful While smaller in size to the grand palace of Gyeongbokgung this is indeed a little treasure. Don t miss the secret Garden it is an extra admission and tickets can be brought outside the entrance of the Secret Garden towards the back of the palace grounds. We were lucky to go late November and the fall foliage was beautiful. The Secret Garden is by tour only. If you appreciate history  learning about Korean royalty history or architecture designs you will love this. ',\n",
       " ' Wonderful! We visited the Changdeokgung Palace as a part of the day trip in Seoul. It is a compex of beautifusl  historical palaces that unfold a rich Korean history. No wonder it is a UNESCO preserved heritag sight. This is a must see while visiting Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Don t miss the secret garden We visited Changdeokgung Palace in November and the fall foliage was beautiful  especially in the secret garden area. Make sure that you get the ticket that admits you to this area  which is at the back of the palace grounds. A must visit site when touring Seoul!',\n",
       " ' Nice outdoor Korean history lesson Overall it was a great experience. Take a lot of photos!! If you re wondering whether or not you should pay the extra buck for Secret Garden  do not hesitate  do it. I visited in the winter and Secret Garden was the highlight of my day. Enjoy beautiful views and architecture while you listen to the tour guide s explanation of why each section of the palace existed    but it does involve a lot of walking and climbing up some stairs  especially during the winter it could be a little harder for older visitors. We spent more time there than originally planned. ',\n",
       " ' Probably the best of the Palaces Really impressive from an architectural viewpoint  with a number of different palaces for the King  the Queen and Concubines. The Secret Garden is a joy  extra charge though  and should be at its best in the Spring. Great place to escape the turmoil of modern day Seoul. ',\n",
       " ' Historical Interesting  but quite a walk not recommended for elderlies. Might be great on summer as flower are bloomed.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful and well preserved First impression was it was like the other palaces  sculptured tiles and painted roofs. Going on a little farther  one came to a part that looked humbler but actually more beautiful. Plain carved wooden wall and roof. This was built for a concubine and done not to stoked the jealousy of the queen. Would love to come here in warmer clime to see the garden.',\n",
       " ' It s a nice palace Very good architecture  worth a trip to understand the culture. You can also walk into the deeper end to see the secret garden and the secondary palace for added charge  boooo.... . ',\n",
       " ' Garden closed today Running second best to Gyeongbokgung this palace still has a thing or two and can hold its own. I really wanted to do the secret garden but it was closed on the day that I visited.',\n",
       " ' Must book the secret garden tour. Those that come here should see the secret garden as well. This palace is quite plain in the winter. The palace felt dull by the lack of colors. ',\n",
       " ' What a place!!! You can t miss this place. Make sure you go there with lots of time  i would say at least 3hours  to explore the area. And please wear comfartable clothes and shoes because you will be walking a LOT. Paying for the guided tour is important for you to learn a lot the local history. Take time to choose a quiet spot  sit down and observe Korea people who goes there. You would be amazed how much you can learn by observing the way they interact with each other  how they respect their culture and people. I was truly amazed!!!',\n",
       " ' Probably the Best UNESCO World Heritage in Seoul Among the palaces we visited in Seoul  this is my favorite. Great architecture. Feels like I was in one of the Saeguk dramas. Don t miss the Secret Garden and Deoksugung within the complex.',\n",
       " ' Lovely palace with great photo opportunities This is a historically significant and beautiful palace to visit during a trip to Seoul. We saw this palace along with others on a tour for people associated with the American military and their families. It is beautiful in the fall and offers many great photo opportunities.',\n",
       " ' Exploring This palace has much to explore  almost every corner has a magical photo opportunity! Especially with all the pretty girls wearing their traditional clothes. Many are more than happy to pose for you  if you ask nicely! We spent around 3 hours walking around all the small buildings and stopped for coffee in the cafe on the grounds   decent coffee  not overpriced at 3500won . ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Palace Settings the palace is 5 minutes walk from Anguk station  exit 1. Fortunately during my visit  I ve been granted by free admission as the palace open for free on the last Wednesday of every months. The temperature was very cold as i visited the place during the winter and i suggest you to avoid winter if you wish to fully explore the beauty of the palace. Winter also not too bad as the scenery was stunning  the roofs covers by white fresh snow that make the buildings looks lovely and romantic. But due to negative temperature  it will limit your steps to explore the entire boundary. Believe me  it is worth to at least pay a visit once to this landmark  you will not regret.',\n",
       " ' excellent very beautiful palace  however  you have to purchase separate ticket if you want to visit backyard garden. i personally think the garden is not so special during winter. they do provide free tour guide in chinese  korean and english. very good service. if you have time  rent traditional korean costume from shops outside the palace will make this trip more memorable. and if i m not wrong  you can enter this palace for free if you are wearing Korean Hanbok. ',\n",
       " ' The Palace with the Secret Garden I chose to go to only this Palace since it s on the UNESCO heritage site list and it also boasts a very beautiful Secret Garden. On the day that I was there  it rained before and as I was leaving the Palace. It s a very beautiful place to go even if just for the garden. I liked that while there were many people there  it wasn t crowded. I bought a ticket for the Secret Garden so there would be a guided tour. The guide wasn t very proficient in English so it was difficult to grasp what he was trying to say. It is easy enough to enjoy the Garden without a guide anyway.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace. Alluring secret garden. My favorite palace. Went 3 times! Really like this palace. I bought a combination ticket but it was not enough for me  I went 3 times! Go early in the morning 9am on a weekday and you practically get the whole palace to yourself. Walk around and immerse in its beauty and serenity. Definitely join a guided tour to know more about the grounds. Check their website for timings for various language guided tours. We went for the 10 30am English tour. Very nice. It ends just in time at 11 20am for you to catch the 11 30am secret garden guided tour. The secret garden is only available on guided tour  with extra ticket  so check online for secret garden reservations or go early to book a spot at the ticket counter. It s worth a visit so don t miss out. Although many buildings are new  as the originals were burnt down during the Japanese war  it s still an interesting place to visit. Recommended! ',\n",
       " ' Korea in the olden days It s for the historical and  or archaeological freak. Cobbled walk corridors  muddy open courtyards  snow covered parks  roof that has its corners flipped and curled upwards towards the sky. It s a little too cold for visiting in the winter. It s probably a nice sight in spring when all the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Nonetheless it still has its charm with snow covered roofs. ',\n",
