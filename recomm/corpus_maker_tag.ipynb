       "[' The Secret Garden within Changdeokgung I have been to Changdeokgung and the Secret Garden twice now. The best times to go would be in the springtime when all the flowers are in full bloom and the garden is alive with bird song. Autumn is also amazing as the fall foliage looks splendid as it complements the palace buildings. It is one of the five grand palaces within Seoul and is conveniently located nearby other popular tourist attractions. There is a separate entrance fee for Changdeokgung palace and the Secret Garden which boasts pavilions  lily ponds  a stream as well as luscious vegetation. You may only enter the Secret Garden as part of an organised tour. The tours are in Korean  English  Japanese  Chinese. For more detailed information and for many photographs please have a look at my blog post                                           ',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden is worth a visit We visited the Secret Garden  and we had the most loveliest guide  Ms Yoon! We chatted a lots after the tour and she was very interested about our home country and our view about Korea. Secret Garden tour is included in the palace pass  but you need to get a separate ticket before entry at the ticket counter near the gates. This is because the tour holds only 50 people at a time and there are language options  English  Korean  Chinese and if I remember correctly Japanese . Palace pass  tickets for all 5 main palace areas Secret Garden  is 10 000 won.',\n",
       " ' Nice place It is a very charming place  the little lake with white water lily. Well maintained place. You have chance to try their traditional dress for photo as well which was fun. I love the architect of this place very much ',\n",
       " ' Interesting tour Interesting tour but be sure to have a guide if you want to get the most out of it. Lots of teens wearing traditional clothes that like having their picture taken.',\n",
       " ' Recommended for those who like history It is good maintained  large  can let you feel the background of The country. I like Vietnam palace more so that I rate 3 points for it.',\n",
       " ' Another Korean masterpiece Excellent example of royal architecture for the Joseon period. Well worth visiting to soak up the historical atmosphere and to see how royalty lived.',\n",
       " ' Short visit but was nice You wont need too much time here   just a overall look not more than 30 minutes. This is the most important sign of seoul when you visit . Great place for history lovers. You can also find some tour leaders to receive detailed information. ',\n",
       " ' no must I went there after visiting the Gyeongbokgung palace and for me they look very similar. I can t even distinguish my pictures being taken in both palaces. Maybe the secret garden would have been more interesting  but the ticket for the garden was a little bit too expensive. I was really bored walking around this palace and took about 10 pictures. I think i needed less than 1 hour. If you have already seen one palace  you can skip this one. The same thing i had to criticize about the Gyeongbokgung  You can never enter the rooms or make a good picture from the intererior.',\n",
       " ' lovely Built in 1405 as a secondary palace with a secret garden. I recommend visiting both the palace and the garden. You must have a tour guide for the garden so plan according to tour times. It is quite breathtaking. ',\n",
       " ' A tradition design palace Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997  it is closed to Buckon Hanok Village  we can walk from metro station of Anguk exit No.3 around 7 10min  very easy to found  you can spend 3 4 hours on Changdeokgung and Buckon Hanok Village together. Nearby it also have Gyeongbokgung  No. 1 palace in Korea.',\n",
       " ' No We spent hours walking around to see where the King lived and where his wife lived  etc.! Beautiful architecture  but no furniture to mention or much else. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Palace This palace is really underrated for its beauty. During my second visit to Korea  I went to Changdeokgung and realised that it was so much more beautiful than Gyeongbukgong. Also  It was much better to take pictures hanbok photos as it is less crowded. I missed out on the secret garden because of itinerary constraints but I would urge people to visit the garden during their visit because it is magnificent.',\n",
       " ' Is magical This enormous palace is good to see in a sunny day. Be ready to walk a lot and if u want to see it all  be there a few hours. There is free tour guides provided and the entrance is only  3 p p. Bring camera  sunscreen and comfy shoes. ',\n",

       " ' Do not miss secret garden.. The place is one of the few historical monuments in the city. It  s pictoresque and if you get beautiful weather it  s a pleasure to walk in. Do not miss secret garden which is the most beautiful and interesting part to visit. Guides in typical korean ancoent costume. ',\n",
       " ' Moonlight tour It was interesting to visit the palace at night  but the number of lit up places was very limited. I wish I had gone there during the day instead.',\n",
       " ' Pleasant morning A couple of hours tops is what you should spend here. They have a lovely garden and the changing of the guard is good to see. ',\n",
       " ' Is ok. Overall i find the Palace in Korea a bit too boring.Is all a shell other than that nothing much to see and everything thing looks the same. Is a shame when you look into the room is either empty or pretty dull. You want to see the richness of it during those days.I reacon they cold do much better. Only highlight i got was the delicious cold Citroen Tea you can buy at the giftshop.That was a really nice drink freshly made lemon tea with pieces of preserved lemons. Loved it.',\n",
       " ' Spectacular and Colorful This is one of the most favored palace by the kings from all other palaces. More colorful  amazing structures  the Secret Garden  makes the place really special. The secret garden tour is a must here. The overall place is big and lots of history to catch. Very near from Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukchon village ',\n",
       " ' The best out of the palaces in Seoul! Changdeokgung has a secret garden which makes it worth the visit. We booked tickets online the day before  which might be neccessary as it might sell out during high season. I would advise to try and go early or later i the afternoon as it was a bit too hot to go mid day in mid August. The palace itself and the surrounding buildings are similar to the other palaces in Seoul  however a walk around the secret garden was very nice and made it stand out from the others. If I remember correctly we were told that the lotus flowers bloom in early September so I guess this would be the best time to go  in order to enjoy the full beauty of the Secret Garden.',\n",
       " ' Great place to visit A great day out for wandering through Korean history. We bought the multi venue ticket which allowed us to visit this palace  including the secret garden  the Jongmyo Shrine  Changgyeonggung Palace  Gyeongokgung Palace and Deoksugung Palace. It cost 10 000 Won. It s worth it if you are going to visit all the places as it costs about 3000 to visit each palace and 1000 to visit the shrine on individual tickets. The grounds are fairly large and we spent the whole morning there. We also visited the secret garden which is lovely but as its only at certain times there were a lot of people and I would have liked to have spent more time there. If you have the ticket book  you can access the Changgyeonggung Palace from this one and save yourself the long walk around to the entrance on the other side. This access is near where the secret garden tour starts. If you haven t got a ticket  there is a ticket booth there so you can still get in. ',\n",

       " ' Historic Experience Changdeokgung Palace was an amazing place to visit. It is easily accessed by the subway station. Inside the palace there are several buildings monuments and even an art gallery open for viewing. If you re there for a specific time you can watch as the palace guards rotate. They also offer the option of wearing traditional Korean garments for free  and within a time limit .',\n",
       " ' Don t miss The most beautiful sceneries I ve seen in Seoul. A huge garden  do the Secret Garden tour   about 6 euros  with architecture of the palace objects fitting the surroundings in a beautiful fashion. Everything sits together perfectly in a picturesque way. This was in summer   it gets even prettier in autumn or winter  we ve seen pictures .    And the tour guide was a Korean lady with the best English I ve heard in this whole week I spent in Seoul  this helps a lot if you wanna hear the explanations .',\n",
       " ' A place of ancient Korea and its history come alive! Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Jongno gu in Seoul. It is one of the  Five Grand Palaces  built by the kings during the Joseon Dynasty. And as such  it was the principal palace for many of the Joseon kings and a 600 year old UNESCO World Heritage Site. We were here for a visit as part of our full day city tour. We arrived at around 9.30am and stayed there for slightly over an hour. It was not crowded when we arrived  perhaps it was still early  and our admission fees had been included in our package tour. But I understand that the admission fee is 3 000 won per adult. The palace ground was massive  with many  interlinked  palace buildings from one to another with a big open compound. Of course what was interesting was the ancient style of architectural design and to some extent  similar to the Chinese style. According to our guide  both ancient China and Korea were good allies and thus the country had some influences from the Chinese culture.  in fact  on the roof top of some buildings were designs of the Chinese classic novel  Journey to the West  with the Monkey God  the Tripitaka Master etc  cool!  Maintenance and conservation work of the buildings had been done here by the city authorities. So we walked from one building to another  with some being able to enter or taking a look from outside on the interior structure of the palaces  such as the King s chair and office  paintings etc! Along the way  we also saw some people wearing the traditional Korean Hanbok costumes  very nice  colourful and lovely  And you are keen  you can try them out too! As we need to visit several attractions in our tour  we were not able to stay to visit the Secret Gardens which according to our guide  was very beautiful and nice! For us  the visit here was generally fine and interesting to learn about the ancient culture of Korea though we would love to see more like in Gyeongbukgung Palace. Weather was very sunny and warm and do remember to bring along an umbrella  hat and drinking water. Well  if you are planning to visit some palaces in your trip here  Changdeokgung Palace is also a good option besides the Gyeongbukgung  though the latter has much more to see  besides the buildings and gardens  bigger  there is also an ancient  change of guard  ceremony. But do take note that the former is closed on Mondays and the latter is closed on Tuesdays!',\n",
       " ' beautiful palace with my family  even though it was so hot day during Aug  but from time to time  can feel windy and it was not that huge like Gyeongbokgung  and building and history was fascinating enough to attract our attention! Something not good is only there was not enough parking space around this palace',\n",
       " ' Average with interesting architecture We came here because the other bigger palace was closed on Tuesday. It was okay  nothing too special in my opinion. But the architect was interesting. It s 3000 won entrance fee and you have to pay extra for the secret garden  which I think is what everyone wants to see. It s another 2000 won and you can only go as part of a guided tour. There is not much shade so it s pretty hot on a summer s day. Bukchon Village and Insadong Street are close by. ',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Palace Best advice  Tour around with a tour guide. Tour guide is free you just have to wait for their schedules. They offer Chinese  English  Japanese and Korean languages. You can check also their website which is very helpful! Tour guides are very passionate they will make you love Korea!! 3',\n",
       " ' New Building Never occupied by the King Nice structures  but a recreation that is only about 15 years old. So the King never sleep here  not have the buildings ever been truly occupied.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace This is a beautiful place. If you watch historical Korean dramas you have to go here. This is one of the palaces in the stories. ',\n",
       " ' saw the ceremony we went at around 930 am and were hustled into the inner yard. there was the ceremonial precession right behind us. The whole thing takes about an hour and they ask you to stay so you don t interrupt  but you can leave. we stayed for about 30 minutes and it was a neat opportunity to see a historic offering take place. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful place I went there with my old parents just yesterday. Another thing to add in your must see list. Personally  I find Gyeongbokgung more beautiful but the Secret Garden tour in this palace is something you should not miss. ',\n",

       " ' Beautiful Palace!!! Must Visit!! I enjoyed visiting this gorgeous palace. It has so much architecture and history! The day we went was free entrance and we only had to pay for the English guided garden tour which lasted an hour. When visiting you can see some Koreans dressed in traditional clothes. It can be very humid and hot so stay hydrated! Also  you can take beautiful pictures so I recommend bringing your best camera. Highly recommended if you are in the area!!! ',\n",
       " ' Lovely If you d like a real life behind the scenes glimpse of the royal palace s gardens  I highly recommend purchasing a ticket for the Huwon Tour  5000 won for an adult . However  you must first purchase an entry ticket for Changdeokgung itself. I was late to the free Changdeokgung tour  so after buying my Changdeokgung Huwon tour tickets  I quickly looked at the palaces in Changdeokgung and then hurried over to star the Huwon tour. Very lovely and well maintained  and it s fun seeing that even back then  the royals appreciated nature and art.',\n",
       " ' it was ok The palace complex was not too big compare to gyeongbokgung. There are too type of entrance. The palace entrance fee didnt include the garden entrance fee  we have to pay additional fee to enter the garden. The throne room was kinda similar with one in gyeongbokgung  but the inner quarter of the king design with western probably victorian style. The complex mostly redecorated during the reign of the last king of joseon...it was easy to reach...the anguk station was 200 meter from the changdeokgung They also offered a bundle ticket for this palace together with 2 other palace  gyeongbokgung and 1 other palace  i forgot  for 10.000W',\n",
       " ' Typical palace Palace was a nice structure with peaceful grounds. Not exactly ancient but does show the character and shows the pan Asian fertilization',\n",
       " ' Immense and Inspiring It sits on several acres and contains over 11o buildings. I was blessed enough to get the free English tour. A MUST SEE.',\n",
       " ' Cheap visit to the Palace We visited this Palace first and glad we did so as Gyeongbokgung Palace is more impressive. Entrance fee is 3000 won and does not include entry into the secret garden. However as we did not want a guided tour for 90 minutes we didn t pay for this. There is a Palace bundle for 10 000 won if you were looking to go to Gyeongbokgung and 2 other palaces. Entry is free for those in traditional Korean outfits and it was nice to see so many dressed in these outfits. The Palace was rebuilt so it looks in good condition and modernish. It is a good place to while away an hour or two and get an idea of the history at a very cheap price. ',\n",
       " ' Great palace This palace is great and less tourist packed than Gyeongbokgung Palace. Should be visited along with Gyeongbokgung and Bukchok Hanok village sinse they are all close to each other If you really are someone who likes to walk I would recommend the following route. Start from Gwanghwamun station  or City hall station and pass Gwanghwamun gate    Gwanghwamun Square  Gwanghwamun Gate   Gyeongbokgung Palace  The folk museum of korea   Bukchok Hanok village   Changdeokgung Palace   Insadong   Cheonggyecheon Stream   Gwanghwamun station.',\n",
       " ' Good choice to visit I didn t pay the entrance fee 3000 KRW  korean won  because it s free on Wednesday of the last week of the months. All palaces are free except the secret garden  5000 KRW  that is behind the changdeokgung. It takes around hour to finish the tour of the palace. ',\n",
       " ' Royal residential villa from the Joseon period Well preserved and in good balance with nature and city  you should visit it. Take care to not come when schools are present.',\n",
       " ' Another beautiful building We saw the changing of the guard which was a lovely sight we also got to dress up in national costume and have our photos taken with the guards.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful We arrived at 9am to ensure we had a place on the 2.30pm Secret Garden Tour  only 50 places per tour available on the day . We then spent the morning at Bukchon Village which is an easy walk away and definitely worth the visit. Palace and Gardens were beautiful and the Garden Tour was a welcome relief from the afternoon sun as it is mostly shaded. Our tour guide was very informative and spoke excellent English. Definitely a must when visiting Seoul.',\n",
       " ' The best well preserved Palace in Seoul! Very beautiful palace with a secret garden separate ticket needed  giuded tour only with freindly giudes who speak English fluently . A good souvenir shop with refreshments and rest rooms. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace This is a beautiful palace  very easy to visit if you are in the insa dong bukchon area. It closes at 5pm  I believe  so make sure to check hours before visiting. There s many places around the palacs that will rent you traditional Korean clothing  hanbok  which makes for a fun and memorable photo opportunities! ',\n",
       " ' Best 5 hours on a lay over...incheon airport Yes  join the city tour for free! Add 10.00 and you get a traditional korean lunch. The palace itself is huge  some stairs  not handicapped accessible. Interesting history of an ancient culture. I wish they have some handouts in different languages since some of the tour guides doesn t speak fluent English. ',\n",
       " ' Do the tour of the palace  secret garden tour a bit of a disappointment We did the 90 min Secret Garden tour as the website stated that it was required in order to enter. When we arrived  we were informed that they now have an option of walking around on your own. We love to learn about what we are looking at so opted to stay with the tour  as did about 70 other people. The guide was in a hurry to cover everything and began commentary before half of the large group had caught up to each location. So it became frustrating to have to run to the front of the group in order to hear the guide. It might ve been more pleasurable to avoid this and just amble around on our own. The palace was impressive. Unfortunately  our small group was not interested in any other tour after the Secret Garden. So  if I had a do over  I would skip the secret garden tour and go for the palace tour. And I would rent one of the traditional dresses from nearby Bukchon to enter for free. Of the two palaces  I like Gyeongbokung better.',\n",
       " ' place and garden The palace is nice  but the gardens are outstanding. If you have a chance to tour both  allow for extra time. The opening hours for palace and garden are different. ',\n",
       " ' Free tour was great We attended the 10.30am free English guided tour and it was very informative. We then went to the 11.30 Secret Garden tour   good but we abandonded half way through to make another engagement   beautiful gardens.',\n",
       " ' A palace closer to earh This palace is more laid back and cozy  make sure 1  you visit the secret garden  it has a separate ticket  2  you go with the free tour provided  check the timing before you go ',\n",
       " ' The Enchanting Huwon Changdeokgung seems like a smaller version of Gyeongbokgung. As a secondary palace  it pales in comparison to the grandeur and majesty of Gyeongbokgung. However  what sets it apart from the main palace complex is that enclosed in it is Huwon or The Secret Garden. For me  that gives you enough reason to add this to your must see attractions. Don t miss out on the guided tour specifically meant for Huwon. It s quite lengthy at 90 minutes and involves some trekking but the captivating serenity of this garden  and hearing anecdotes about the Korean monarchs who frequent the garden would make it worth the trouble!',\n",
       " ' Nice architecture    I really like the architecture of these ancient palaces. Another thing that might be nice to see is the change of the guards. Always a nice show of itself.',\n",
       " ' Busy but amazing Definitely worth visiting if you are in Seoul. The architecture is amazing and there are lots of things to see  so make sure you have some time up your sleeves to really wander around and see everything you can. There are a lot of people visiting too though so I suggest going early in the morning or in the late afternoon.',\n",
       " ' a slice of history A wonderful place to wander around a learn about the history of Korea. Come early in the morning to avoid crowds and to take the best pictures.',\n",
       " ' Time your visit right to make the most of this attraction You need to arrive fairly early if you want to do the secret garden tour after the palace tour. English speaking guides take the tour around the palace at 10.30am and the secret garden tour kicks off at 11.30am. We turned up a bit late so although we had the palace tour  the garden tour was sold out and we had to wait until 1.30pm for that. Luckily our hotel was very near so we nipped back there as there isn t really another two hours of activity once you have toured the palace. The talk was very good at giving an insight into court life  meaning when we later went to Gyeongbokgung Palace we didn t feel it necessary to join a guided tour. Word of warning to the infirm  the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense  especially in the heat. It s also worth buying the four palace pass if you intend to visit all the palaces in Seoul. We only did these two  but I d recommend them both. Gyeongbokgung is much bigger and also contains two fantastic museums. A real must visit.',\n",
       " ' Another Must Visit Place There are a few palaces in Seoul. This palace is near some other places of interest such as Bukchon village and Insadong. So  why would we skip this when we were also visiting other attractions nearby?',\n",
       " ' Don t Miss the Secret Garden The real attraction of Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden. The palace itself was not as fascinating to us as Gyeongbokgung or Deoksugung which had costumed actors on site and changing of the guard pageantry. We visited Changdeokgung on a Sunday morning. No performers were in costume  although quite a few locals visiting were in colorful traditional Korean attire. An English speaking guide took us on a tour of the buildings which were interesting  but the Secret Garden tour was the real attraction. It s best to make reservations at least 24 hours in advance for the Secret Garden tour. We managed to see the palace grounds at 10 30am  followed immediately by the garden tour at 11 30am. The walled garden is beautifully landscaped with water features  trees  flowers  and Korean style buildings and pagodas. The royal family spent their leisure time here  so every aspect of the garden is well planned. The first 45 minutes of the walk is easy  the second half apparently  more athletic  we were told by the guide  so we decided to take it easy at go back at the halfway point. Cost is 3 000 KRW for the palace and 5 000 KRW for the garden.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace in Seoul My first time to visit Korea s palace and it was amazing. We took a lot of pictures at the entrance as there was some men who wearing the tradition Korean customs. It was a pity that we didn t spend much time at the palace and wish to try the Korean customs. We also didn t have time to visit the secret garden. For me  I will visit this palace next time.',\n",
       " ' Ok If you have limited time.. Or even just don t want to walk about alot  just visit Gyeongbokgung palace. This one is similar but Gyeongbokgung had more to offer. ',\n",

       " ' Beautiful palace Different to Gyeongbukgung Palace  in that the architecture seems less grand and imposing  but still worth visiting for its beautiful grounds. The gardens within the grounds are lush and beautiful and I would recommend buying the inexpensive guide book from the front gate if you can t make the tour times. ',\n",
       " ' World Heritage of Joseon Dynasty Changdeokgung Palace is located not far away from both Anguk station and Jongnosam ga metro staion. It is 15 minutes walk. The palace is vast and has 2 sections  the Main Palace and the Secret Garden. Both have its entrance fee. Visiting this world heritage complex needs 2 hours walk around. It is a beautiful place to visit.',\n",
       " ' A must see in Seoul but very similar with Gyeongbokgung This palace has definitely more buildings to visit than Gyeongbokgung  but here you do not have any change of guards ceremony to watch. I found the visit not really exciting  as the buildings look like very similar as the ones in Gyeongbokgung.',\n",

Join the garden tour  the story and explanation is interesting and meaningful to learn about Korea s culture and history.

The tour goes through some slopes and hills  so be sure to wear comfortable shoes for walking. Tour guide was really friendly and is willing to answer all our questions. After the secret garden tour  we visited some other buildings in the palace  there are very similar with other palace  so nothing new for us.',\n",
       " ' An impressive palace My fiance and I visited this palace on a Sunday afternoon. The sheer size of the palace is quite impressive and it is well worth the 3 000 won entrance fee.

Opening hours  palace and secret garden  is from 09 00. Closing time varies between 16 30 to 18 00 depending on the time of year. Closed on Mondays.

I personally prefer the Changedeokgung more due to the Secret Garden. You can only visit the secret garden by joining the guided tour. I would recommend that you book the ticket via its website in advance to avoid disappointment. It s an hour and a half tour and it s a pity that one is not allowed to stay and explore more after the tour. ',\n",
       " ' Best palace The secret gardens make this tour worth it. Even though it is ranked higher  we thought this palace was better than Gyeongbukgung Palace.

The visit would have been nicer if the weather was cooler. The entrance fee is 3000 but I would advise you to get the Secret Garden tour which includes the entrance fee at 8000. For a 1.5 hour tour they bring you further inside and you get to see more. The palace is peaceful and beautiful but I was a little underwhelmed. Asked a friend who went to Gyeongbokgung palace  she says it is grander than this palace so wished I gone to that one instead.',\n",

The palace has a  Secret garden  but note that you will have to purchase a separate ticket for that because you may only visit in a group. Perfect for a hot day because in the garden the trees will make a cooling shadow over the paths. The place is very quiet even though it is almost in the heart of Seoul.

       " ' to understand korean history This one of the must do in terms of Korean tourist sites. It had vast and big grounds and a lot of palace buildings yet had an eerie tranquil feeling about it. The buildings seemed to be constantly destroyed and rebuilt   which is a bit like the psychic of the Korean history   forever under attack. It is an interesting way to learn the history of Korea and how hard it must have been. The grounds were really big so it was an impressive show   well spent the afternoon meandering around. A lot of the Koreans were also walking around taking photos in their traditional outfits as one gets free entrance wearing the traditional Hancock.',\n",
       " ' Get package deal with the Secret Garden When you go here  you should definitely get a ticket to see the Biwon Secret Garden. When I joined the English tour at 10 30 am  the English tour for the Secret Garden followed right afterwards at 11 30 am which made things convenient. Both guides did a good job explaining the palace and the garden.',\n",
       " ' Favorite Palace! This is my favorite palace in Seoul. I have lived here for a couple of years and have seen all of the palaces multiple time with all the guests who come visit. I have been here twice and it is beautiful. I recommend doing both tours if you have time. I was reluctant to do the palace tour  on my 9th palace visit  but really enjoyed it. The guide focuses on telling you what happened in each building and how they were used as well as fun little stories about the people who lived there. It was a tour unique to this place and moved at a good speed. The garden tour really depends on the guide. My first time he was fantastic and gave funny stories about each place and the second he let us wander alone a bit more. No matter what you must do the tour to see the garden  which is really the whole point of this place. Strongly recommend   if you only see 1 palace other than Gyeongbukgung this should be it.',\n",

       " ' Changdeokgung Palace It is one of the  Five Grand Palaces  built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty  13921897 . It was heavily damaged during the Japanese Occupation of Korea  19101945 . It was the site of the royal court and the seat of government until 1868. Korea s last Emperor Sunjong  lived here until his death in 1926. Currently  only about 30  of the pre Japanese structures survive and consist of 13 buildings remaining on the palace grounds and 28 pavilions in the gardens  occupying 110 acres. This palace is extremely beautiful and well kept. It is a pleasure to see how Koreans have gone to great length to preserve their history.',\n",
       " ' The Secret Garden is a must see You buy a ticket and join a group tour in your language   English  Korean  Chinese or Japanese. Exquisitely landscaped garden  quite a bit of up and down walking but plenty of opportunities to sit and reflect. So peaceful in the bustling heart of the city. Definitely one of my favourite places in Seoul and I would definitely go again.',\n",
       " ' The highlight is the Secret Garden After visiting Geongbokgung  we think that this palace is a waste of time! Its true that both have their attractions but there are so much more to see in Gyeongbok! We did not go to the Secret Garden  though.',\n",
       " ' Second best A must see. Personally  I prefer the Gyeongbokgung Palace but maybe you need to see both to appreciate the subtle differences. A stroll through the complex takes around 30min on your own  the guided tours last 1hr but as we had kids  we lasted only about 10minutes before backing out. I d recommend to book for the Secret Garden tour online to guarantee your spot as it can get very busy and you might not get in on your preferred times. The secret garden tour lasts 1.5hrs and is perfectly doable even with small kids. If you have a stroller or a scooter  bring it with you. There is no refreshments throughout the whole complex  so stock up on something to nibble on. A water bottle is a must too. Allow roughly 2 3hrs to visit.',\n",
       " ' Peace and quiet It s quite a bit larger than the palace we visited earlier but there aren t as many people here. The peace and quiet is wonderful and we are looking forward to touring the Secret Garden. ',\n",

       " ' Secret Garden   Must See! If you are going to Changdeokgung  secret garden is a must see. I heard there are limited people allowed to go in the secret garden at one time  so what we did is reserve the slot online. There are several slots of guided tour in Korean  Japanese  English and Chinese. Expect hilly roads so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. But all the breathtaking views make every steps worthwhile to be able to witness with your own eyes and capture inside the memories and photos.',\n",

       " ' Beautiful Palace and Secret Garden Unfortunately I came over too early in Autumn. The leaves were still green and didnt get to see the red fall leaves season which would have made it more beautiful. To join huwon secret garden tour  head to the secret garden counter to buy the tickets separately for a set tour time. the tour is availabe in english  korean  japanese and chinese. normally  you can only go in with a tour. But this time they allowed visitors to roam away from the tour group giving more time and privacy to take selfies without the crowd in the background. Changdeokgung palace itself was pretty impressive especially if u watch a lot of period K Dramas. More impressive than Gyeongbokgung palace in my opinion. If you re planning to visit all the palaces and huwon secret garden tour  do get the combination passes for only 10 000won. More value in my opinion. ',\n",

The palace itself is cozy and not exhausting  interesting to see the layout  but the secret garden is the major attraction here  so please make sure you visit it! It s spread on a relatively wide surface but the alleys are very pleasant and it conveys peace and calm  it s a definite must. You hand to join a tour in order to be able to enter  at specific hours  and it takes about 1.5h but it s totally worth it and the guide was very gifted to transport us in the mood and the stories of the time. ',\n",
       " ' A must see as one of the first things to do in Seoul I d recommend this as your first stop in Seoul to get a feel for what Korea has to offer. It will most likely also be all the palaces and temples you will want to see for your whole time in Seoul  which is fair because there s so much more to do in the city. Maybe my expectations were too high  but while I found it was nice to walk around and experience something I don t normally see which is of high historic value  I found it a little underwhelming. Although for such a low price it s definitely worth it. You re free to walk around by yourself without a tour  plenty of opportunities to take photos  the tour isn t really essential unless you want to learn a lot about the history. The Secret Garden tour is reasonably good and gives you enough information about the palace to keep you satisfied. Even then  you re not really missing out if you don t take a tour  but it s still nice to do. Jongmyo is the only place in the area where you ve forced to take a tour 6 days of the week  so if you have limited time I d recommend not taking any tours here.',\n",
       " ' beautiful architecture the palace follows the usual style of these types of buildings  There s not really much to see but the interiors of the buildings have a lot of interesting detail and if you can get a tour guide it makes the visit and understanding the context more enjoyable',\n",

Took free English tour. Felt walking in a normal garden. But totally disappointed. Guide used to show a simple hut with no great architecture and give its history. I got to know that I am doomed when they told that the 1st place we will visit iin the garden is the most beautiful place. A big no from my side.',\n",
       " ' After a While All These Palaces Begin to Look Alike There are several palaces of this type in Seoul. If you are expecting a palace in the European sense you will be disappointed. Korean palaces are interesting and quite unique  but  for me  a little goes quite a long way. I would recommend visiting one  or two maximum  palace  give yourself about an hour  and then move on to something else.',\n",
       " ' History 2 This was my favorite palace  and was recommended by a local as theirs as well. It truly blends Korean architecture with nature. The grounds are surrounded with trees and is much prettier than the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Only frustrating part was that you had to pay an additional fee to view the secret garden. It was really nice that they had a snack bar with free wifi and AC  as it was really hot!!!! ',\n",

       " ' Great Historical Introduction to Korea A friend and I took the Secret Garden Tour  1.5 hour tour  and it provided a satisfactory perspective of Korea s history   from its early beginnings to today. Our guide spoke very easy to understand English and used an amplifier so that everyone could hear her. I was amazed to see her wearing a traditional hanbok in the heat and humidity! The gardens are very beautiful  feature several water fixtures  and wind through a seemingly endless supply of architecturally beautiful pavilions. It does not feel like you are in the middle of a busy city with all the green trees providing shade overhead. With that said  the tour can still be a little tiring. There are numerous hills and you will walk a fair distance. I would recommend bringing water and insect repellent. There is a cafe at the entrance to the palace and a souvenir shop near the large pond in the Secret Garden Tour. You will find different souvenirs at each so if you see something you like  buy it  as it may not be at the other shops. I purchased a collection of Korean stamps! There were some neat looking trees on the property   one that is believed to be at least 700 years old! There were lots of photo opportunities and the tour guide was good a maintaining a good pace   not too rushed! Recommend if you want to see a palace.',\n",

Was an interesting place to walk around and appreciate the historic architecture  but we didn t realize that you have to book inside tours in advance.

The reason for the second time was because I was not able to catch the Secret Garden tour and I was with a different set of friends the second time i went I m not sure how this palace is compared to the other palaces but i t definitely good for picture taking and it s near the bukchon hanok village  D The first time you arrive here you ll be thrilled by the giant ark at the front. I am not sure how long we spent just to get a perfect picture there. When you go inside  the doors and the koreanovela feels will hit you! if you are a fan  D . After a while it will feel kind of boring as the palace is very big haha and i m sure you ll feel tired! But despite this i would definitely recommend this place and the huwon tour i would recommend on autumn or spring because the trees are dry when we got there. After this you can go straight to bukchon hanok for more of the koreanovela feel.  D',\n",

       " ' Favorite Palace in Seoul For me  this is my favorite palace in Seoul. Not as grand as Kyong Bok  but charming in it s own way. Stunning architecture and landscaping. The secret gardens are well worth the extra ticket. Visitors are allowed in small groups of about 50 people at a time. In the Secret Garden  Beewon  you can see magnificent ponds  smaller intimate scale buildings made for the royal family and unusual sets of buildings intended for the royals to  experience  a rustic village. The area for poetry writing and drinking is well preserved.',\n",

This castle is huge  we took our leisure to walk from one room to another. Each room has explanation on the function in multiple languages.

Perhaps I m a cultural   history heathen or jaded from too many palaces  but I found this palace bland. It was like a virtual reality  a blank canvas waiting for action and features. It was also very similar to the Gyeonbok Palace For me it was a modern building  a replica of something that may have been on the site. It would have also benefited from some grass.',\n",

It was a 5 mins walk and hard to get out of bed with the cold weather. But I am glad I did it. This is my 3rd palace for the week. And though I missed the glorious autumn leaves  I was rewarded at Deoksugung   this palace is not a UNESCO heritage site for nothing. It is the grandest of the 3 palaces I visited  the other being Gyeonbokgung  and it suitably named as a palace. The Korean Tourist Office has done a wonderful job managing my expectations that it is not as grand as China s. This palace has the history and grandeur. Our guide was the best guide of all the tours I had. She speaks English with an American accent and it was easy to understand her. As my tour ends at 11 25pm  I rushed to the Secret Garden s English Tour which starts at 11 30am. Trust me  it was super freezing and I was having second thoughts. Especially when our guide was warning as of the long walk and steps. Then I looked around. There are folks with strollers! I have to press on !! One third through the tour  at this beautiful part with the pond and the pavilion is.......it started to snow !! Magical !! And the snow got heavier and heavier. I d never forget this special moment! The last time I experienced this  it was in Nikko Japan  and that was about 10 years ago! So it you are only in Seoul for a short time  and have to choose ONE to go.....this is the one. It was too cold for me to linger around after the cold. So I hurried back to get my umbrella and to watch to snow falling out of my window before catching authentic lunch at a hanok. If you are in the area  end your tour with lunch at Gung Hanjeogsik. You need to cross the right traffic light  coming out from main entrance. Walk straight down the first road  then turn left. It s not easy to find  but worth it! I have come to realised  this trip  that having many reviews in TA on a particular restaurant is not necessarily the best. It could have been overly commercialised. It s super! And if you want stretch your visit to this area more  visit the',\n",

The palace is humongous so be prepared for a very long walk. Also note there really isn t much food you can purchase within the palace itself except for some drinks  so be prepared for that as well. The palace does get a bit repetitive at times  although the nicely manicured grounds do make up for it.',\n",

The guide was able to relate what takes place in the different buildings and pavilions and makes one feel that they were part of the ceremonies. The palace is open 9 00 to 18 00 but during winter only up to 17 30. It is also closed on Mondays. Adults pay Won3 000 or a little below  3 and children pay W1 500 . if traveling on your own  you can take the subway or the Bus and join the scheduled tours by the park like English is 10 30 and 14 30... The palace is preserved and restored even after it was destroyed during the Japanese invasion  1592 1598  and after that was used by the monarchy for 270 years.

       " ' Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul This is a series of beautiful buildings and a palace where the royal family lived. Its architecture blends with the surrounding nature and landscape. The Palace is where the kings dealt with state affairs. All the buildings are decorated and made of wood and have a stone platform. Being of wood  they have been damaged by fires during the centuries and rebuilt. The whole park is quite big and includes ponds and many tress  some of which seemed very old.',\n",
       " ' Spellbound Rented the audio guide and took a guided tour of the Secret Garden as well.Very interesting facts about the palace s history and sights rituals of the people such as floor heating were revealed by our guide.Sadly I couldn t visit the Geyongbokgung Palace but this made up for it somehow. The Quen s King s and the Prince s palace were very mesmerising. Do remember the Secert Garden has an additional fee and times to be visited with an English guide.',\n",
       " ' Just Like How It Is In The Dramas If you re a fan of historical dramas from Korea this is a MUST VISIT place! It looks exactly as it is on the dramas. We went there when it was Chuseok so there we re cultural performances which was really cool. The entrance fee is cheap and if your wear a Hanbok  traditional Korean clothes  which you can rent in stores outside the palace  your entrance fee is waived. Next time  I wanna try going there at night.',\n",
       " ' Average If you have been to any palace or temple in Japan. This will be boring. The buildings aren t amazing  not as  grand . Wife rented a hanbok and got into the palaces for free. Both of us aren t interested in the history  so 2 hours in there mainly taking pics of my wife with the hanbok. If you come to this one  no need to visit the other palace.',\n",

The architecture and very detailed designs of the palace are impressive. They have maintained these sites so well without altering the original set up. When you re in Seoul  at least visit one of these heritage sites. This requires lots of walking and climbing of stairs. You need need to be fit though but good walking tour.',\n",

       " ' Interesting This is one of Seoul s famous palaces  a bit like a miniature Forbidden City. The place has been very well restored  and it s certainly worth a visit. But the fact that the interiors are unfurnished is a bit disappointing. The highlight is definitely the beautiful Secret Garden. We visited in November  so were treated to the beautiful autumn colours.',\n",

       " ' One of the most beatiful and memorable sites The palace is located in the center of Seoul  so it is easy to get there. The entrance fee is quiet reasonable likewise other palaces in South Korea. You could breathe the life of royalties and their servants there. In addition  there is a remarkable garden inside of the palace. That is called  Secret Garden   one of UNESCO s World Heritage sites in the palace. To visit the garden  it would be better to book the tour in advance since there is a limitation of number of people per each tour. If you visit there  you will be able to enjoy the small pavilions which is in harmony with beautiful nature. The nearest subway station is Anguk Station  orange line line number 3 .',\n",

We discovered this at the first one we visited. It was a cool day and overcast. We figured it was good the admission was free because unlike other castles and palaces  all three of the palaces in Seoul are just empty buildings. We enjoyed the walk around the lake and the forested areas. ',\n",

Yes  architecture is interesting  and in a city of modern buildings  certainly a sense of the real Korea. But for me  building after building  without any context. I deliberately didn t read anything about the pace  just so that I could find our more when I was there   so I m none the wiser. ',\n",

Be at the palace early to roam around and join the 10.30 General Tour  English  around the palace grounds. You will still make it for the 11.30am secret garden tour which takes 1.5 hours. Following the tours make it so much easier to appreciate and understand the stories behind the buildings. You can either choose to get off Jongno 3 ga station  exit 6  or Anguk station  exit 3  depending on where you stay. We got the Royal Palace Pass which is 10 000 won and allows us entry to 4 palaces  including Gyeongbokgung  and the Jongmyo Royal Shrine.',\n",

The secret garden tour which is seperate so you should book in advance on the internet  cost for garden and palace is 7 euro and with that you get a free english guide  do check the time as the guides on english are not that often but we took the 13 30 tour of the secret garden and caught the 14 30 english tour of palace Nice thing to do if the weather allows. The garden is nice with 400 year old trees  nice water areas and great for walking on a sunny day',\n",

The buildings are so colorful and well preserved. We even got to enjoy tea inside one of the rooms near the royal kitchen which had been converted to a cafe. We did a DIY tour which was not difficult as signages abound and there was sufficient information for all the structures. We also visited the Biwon  Secret  Garden afterwards. The guided tour was very informative.',\n",

It was nice to spend the morning here.',\n",
       " ' More to see than Gyeongbokgung This palace was built as asummer residence by the most important Joseon Dynasty in 1405 but it eventually served as the main residence for 270 years when the Japanese ruined the Gyeongbokgung in the late 1500 s. The garden must be very pretty in summer. ',\n",

       " ' Palace with Secret Garden I found that the other palaces are just as interesting if not more  but the Secret Garden  which is an extra admission  is the highlight of this place. If you go  you must take a walk around the garden. If time is short  I think Gyeongbokgung Palace is more interesting.',\n",
       " ' Fun visit This property was a good tour. They have several English speaking guides and tours throughout the day. The guide was knowledgeable and I recommend you take this tour as the guide had a few free tips that were of interest. The tour finished in 50 minute and finished just outside the entrance to the secret garden. We didn t have enough time to fit in the secret garden on this trip  but not because of the tour length as it ended near the secret garden about 10 minutes prior to that for starting. ',\n",
       " ' Interesting The palace grounds were expansive and the trees and leaves on the grounds were coloured beautifully in shades of red yellows and orange in Early december. We have signed up for the secret garden tour which proved was great as the guide was very informative on the history and description of the area. The gardens were also equally beautiful with the historical buildings and a backdrop of autumnal flora and fauna. This would definitely be on my must visit list for Seoul. I would advise visitors to look up secret garden tour timings in their language prior to their visit as you can only enter the secret garden as part of a guided tour group. The grounds and garden are filled with plenty of steep steps and slopes   would advise those with walking difficulty to give this a pass as it would be hard to move around. There is only a small shop beside the gift shop offereing coffee and light refreshments   visitors would definitely have to head elsewhere for food.',\n",

       " ' Walk in Balmy Spring Night This palace is open at night for certain period of the year. It used to be at the center of heavy and noisy traffic with a zoo. Now it is relatively quieter neighborhood. Without a zoo. One amazing development is all the walkways are accessible to wheelchairs. It opens at 7 at night. As it is less popular than another palace in downtown  it is less hubbub. You can enjoy a great walk feeling the spring air. No street vendors. Only some security guards as guiders. It was always there  you can find. I hope more spaces would be open and it would be connected to Secret Garden and Royal Family Garden. It would be then two hour walk. As of now  it was about 30 minutes walk. ',\n",

       " ' Changing of the Guard At 10am promptly every morning you can watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Colorful  and not too crowded  we thoroughly enjoyed the pomp and ceremony. Lots of youngsters wearing national costume to the event   apparently you can rent them nearby for a couple of hours for a small fee and entry to the Palace will then be free   and lots of buses dropping off groups of school children. Well worth a visit.',\n",
       " ' Incredible palace complex. This vast palace complex is packed with beautiful buildings that would be massive draws by themselves in any other city in the world. The concentration of stunning architecture  huge courtyards and beautiful gardens is just wonderful. There are larger single temples in many places but here it s on an incredible scale I ve not seen before. And it costs less than 2.50 to visit! Also  I went on a Monday afternoon and saw a military parade in traditional dress too  which was great.',\n",

Once inside wander the paths and you ll find the various gardens  each with their own charm. There are some nice places to sit and take everything on as well. ',\n",

       " ' Peaceful place in the city This is a beautiful palace that you are free to explore at your own pace for just  1. The buildings are well maintained and there are several styles to see. Don t miss the concubines area to enjoy some different designs. I couldn t get into see the secret garden as a tour needs to be booked  It takes more than an hour to see it . Even without the garden  it was a lovely place to stroll. We spend an hour or so  and it was enough time. Theres a small coffee shop gift shop which is a great place to get a drink  we had ginger ice tea and loved it  and then sit inside or out and just enjoy this peaceful place.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful garden We visit this palace on October. It was very beautiful  but they say it will be 100 times better in the fall  late October to November  when all the leaves turn to yellow. Prepare to walk a lot as this place is very big',\n",

       " ' It is another must! Great architecture of traditional Korean buildings  give you an idea of how they lived in past times. Very fascinating and educative. Loads of cute girls around visiting  wearing traditional Korean dresses. It is another must  in order to appreciate the local culture. You haven t been to Seoul if you don t visit it! ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Palace and Gardens Well preserved and the main draw is the beautiful  secret garden  where the Royal family members go to to relax and entertain. The ponds  pavilions and trees come out beautifully in photos. If you intend to visit more than one Palace it is best to buy the Combination Ticket of 10 000 won as the fee to enter Changdeokgung is 3 000 won and another 5 000 for entry into the secret garden.',\n",

Its Secret Garden is hotly sought after in autumn  booking of entry for the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung is via internet  6 days in advance  and all the places will be taken up within an hour or so  booking starting at 10 00 local time . Changdeokgung itself is quite typical but the Secret Garden looks more ancient and has retained much of the original character  despite the re built .

       " ' Not so Secret Garden As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction  such as the Secret Garden here  and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference bearing in mind that numbers can be limited The buildings in the main palace area are impressive in their size and magnificence   highly restored and in some cases I guess recreations The entrance ticket does not allow access to the Secret Garden a separate timed ticket has to be obtained  and can be pre booked online . You pick a time that coincides with your preferred language  numbers are limited to 30 per tour  Luckily you do not have to stick with the tour guide   but can wander off and look around the garden independently. It covers an immense area and is hilly in parts. Even with a limit on numbers it does get very crowded   especially with noisy school parties   so not such a  secret !! Everything was well maintained with some of the areas being restored. Throughout the site visitor amenities are excellent',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Architecture Stunning palace and very ornate. It is walking distance between two other palaces and the area is easily accessible by metro train.',\n",
       " ' Serene and Beautiful I visited on a Wednesday. Contrary to the information in some other reviews  there are many secret garden tours available  including 4 per day in English  this depends on the time of year  see the palace website for full details . Currently  the tours take 200 people instead of the palace website stated 100  this may have been due to Chinese National Day. 50 tickets can be booked ahead and the rest are claimed at the palace. I was able to purchase tickets at 11 15 for the 11 30 tour. As for the palace itself  very nice and the layout is very different from palaces I ve seen before. While some of the layout is perpendicular building and walkway placement  much of it is off at odd angles to meld seamlessly with the natural terrain. This was a nice contrast to the forbidden city in Beijing. The garden tour is definitely worth the time  90 minutes . The tour guide has some useful information and the tour group quickly dwindles to a reasonable size  but you re free to leave the tour guide from the start if you like to do your own thing.',\n",
       " ' Visit the secret garden! The exterior is not as spacious and grand as Gueongbokgung. However  it s a prettier palace with more trees and a mysterious feel. Go visit the secret garden for a stroll  5000Won per entry  We had a great time enjoying the scenery and breeze inside. There are slopes and much steps at the end of the walk and not suitable for person with walking inconvenience.',\n",
       " ' Nice The palace is actually a complex of buildings which is very nice to visit. Inside there is an additional palace for which an extra ticket is required. I had not planned to visit it and indeed did not. Inside there is also the Secret Garden  also additional ticket. I took it and was not impressed. Would recommend to skip.',\n",
       " ' Nice buildings It s 3 000W to get in then another 5 000W for the secret garden tour. A nice bunch of buildings but to be honest A LOT of it is inaccessible  you can only look from the outside   there isn t too much in between  the grounds feel sparse   and of course so little of it is original. A huge number of people come here each day so I wouldn t call it peaceful but an ok place to visit if it s the only palace you go to while in Seoul.',\n",

       " ' Nice palace The palace is a great place to see Korean history. There is a changing of the guard that is a must see. Don t know if they are there all the time but there were kids dressed in traditional clothes. Fun to take pics with. There is an entrance fee into the back of the grounds. Did not have the time so did not go in further. A must see! ',\n",

       " ' Tours Make The Experience Pros  UNESCO world heritage site  beautiful architecture and grounds  free tours in multiple languages Cons  Can be crowded  especially with school groups   historical perspective is missed without the tour guide explanations  lots of walking. I visited the palace on an afternoon in October  the weather was perfect for a few hours outside. Although there were quite a few school groups there  I didn t have to wait to take the tours in English. I purchased the combined ticket  palace and a secret garden  for 8 000 won   a bargain in my opinion. The architecture was really neat  from the designs and colors to the building sizes and concepts. The tour guides did a great job of explaining the little details that you might overlook  for example  I would never have guessed that the larger doorways were only for the emperor  while the smaller doorways were for the government officials and others   using those smaller doorways required the individuals to  bow  as the entered. Personally  while I enjoyed the palace grounds  I liked the secret garden better  but this was due in part to the excellent tour guide and her details on how it was used by the emperors. The explanations and history changed the experience  bringing the buildings to life as one considers what it must have been like in the garden hundreds of years ago. I did note that the tour moves at a fairly set pace  and it is better if you focus on staying with the guide so you can see and hear her details   you can always walk back through areas at your own pace then the tour is over.

       " ' Giant palace with a hidden lotus pond We visited Changdeokgung palace on a Sunday around 10am and the crowds have fully yet to arrive. A great time to be there since there is very little shade to beat the heat or cover you from the rain. There are several palaces as you continue to walk inside. There is a small fee to get inside but you will be greeted with a relaxing lotus pond towards the end of the palace. ',\n",
       " ' Absolutely stunning Different from Gyeongbokgung with the layout of the buildings done in such a way as to blend with the topography  this is a beautiful place. I visited both here and Gyeongbokgung and if you have time for only one of the two  this is the one. Excellent free tours in English. Entrance is a frankly ridiculous 3000 won  and a small guide book at 500 won can surely hardly cover the printing cost. Plan your visit to make sure that you get the tour of the Huwon secret gardens. Twice the size of the palace area  these are just stunning but can only be visited as part of a tour  with numbers limited  and costs a further 5000 won  buy both tickets at the same time . Be aware that there is walking involved  not all of it flat  and the tour takes a little time. The palace tour will finish in time for the Huwon tour  and close to where it starts. I got the 10.30 palace tour and the 11.30 Huwon tour and was finished at 13.00. ',\n",
       " ' Really good experience for 3 hours A must see place. Built of 3 major attractions  2 Palaces and 1 secret garden. You will pay 9 000 won to gain entry to all 3 and it s worth it. Have fun.',\n",
       " ' Exploring SEOUL We went to Seoul in June  it was quite hot  I had high expectations about Seoul but so far it was just an average trip that didn t have much attraction. We went to Changdeokgung Palace. I like places with history and story attached to it. I enjoyed the food but didn t love it. I guess enjoying loving your travel will depend on the places that you go. So maybe next time I will try the outskirts of Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Quiet and pretty If visiting the Secret Garden  it is quieter and less crowded than Gyeongbukgong because you must book a tour to enter. In my opinion  this is a top site to visit in Seoul. The garden is small but pretty and tranquil. It does not compare at all in terms of splendor or grandeur to the imperial gardens of China  but does have its own unique flavor. It is clean and well preserved. If you can  plan to spend a bit of time relaxing there. There are a number of small pavilions set up with books there to chill. A very nice touch. wear your hanbok for free admission. ',\n",
       " ' Simpler Palace Part of the tour was a visit to Changdeokung Palace. Its design is not as detailed and intricate as that of Gyeongbokgung. It is much simpler and there were few people who visited this palace. Considered as Changdeokgung Palace was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee.',\n",
       " ' A nice escape inside the city For me  visiting Seoul has been a lot of hustle and bustle. The Palace and Gardens were still very busy but visiting provided a but of respite from the crowds of Insadong. Changdeokgung is one of four palaces  plus a shrine  in the area but is the only one that has a separate tour of the gardens. The secret garden area is by tour only  large groups limited to 100 per tour  and they have different times with different languages. For entrance plus the garden tour it is 8000 won  but for only 10 000 won you can get a palace pass to visit the other 4 locations within 3 months of purchase. Definitely get the pass! The other four locations included are Gyeonbokgung palace  Changgyeonggung palace  Deoksung Palace and the Jongmyo Shrine. My husband and I went on an afternoon English tour on a Saturday afternoon. The guide provided insight into how the royal family lived and used each of the buildings within the garden area and spoke english very clearly. The fall foliage makes it an excellent time to visit the gardens with a wide variety of trees changing. I believe the tour lasts about an hour and a half and does have steep hills to walk up. Other than the garden tour  the palace is mostly just open space. The buildings themselves are beautiful and historically interesting  but there isn t a whole lot going on other than the buildings themselves. You will likely see many visitors dressed up in traditional Korean Hanbok taking photos within the palace. If you d like  any places in the area rent these  I know I saw a few in the Insadong market  My favorite thing about visiting the palaces is that they are literally right in the middle of the city. The city grew around the palaces so it is an interesting juxtaposition of the old and new. Definitely worth a visit  if you have to choose just one palace I d pick Changdeokgung. By Metro get off at Anguk Station and follow exit signs for  Changdeokgung Palace  When you exit  continue straight a few blocks and you ll walk right into it on your left.',\n",

In case of plague  war  fire or any disaster  Changdeokgung is a backup. ',\n",

If you want to know more about South Korea s history  this is the way to go. It only took us a 3 5 min. Walk from our guesthouse   Guesthouse Korea . There was a performance for like every 20 mins or so? Where performers dress up as the way that people dressed before and did the rituals etc. To depict the old times. At the end of the ceremony  some performers stand outside the palace and station there where you can take a picture with them  Proper manners and gestures should be observed. They ll feel violated if you get touchy with them.  Inside  I can say that the overall palace is well maintained. The comfort rooms are also great. Once you get out  you will see the front of the Blue House  you can also take a stroll in the side walks to enjoy the streets of Korea while enjoying the views of the falling leaves of the tree s',\n",

The palace is very big  well preserved. A lot of small garden  areas... if you can ask for the map it will be very helpful. The buildings  houses  temples  gates  halls... are quite impressive. Peaceful after all the tourists have left. I left the Secret Garden  separate ticket  til 1400  after I saw the palace. It was just me. But in the late afternoon when all the tourists went home  and a lot of locals  couples would be there in their traditional dress. Really enjoyable time  quite place to see the true tranquillity of the place. Ask the locals for photographs  they are more than welcome to let you do it and offer to take photo for them too   ',\n",

It is really beautiful and great for photo taking. ',\n",

       " ' Good place to visit All the palaces in Seoul are alike. If you are not a specializing in korean history than visit one or two will be enough. This one one of the most famous one. It has two parts palaces and garden. For the garden you require separate ticket   be careful and ask in advance in ticket office  you only can access garden like a part of free guided tour but you have to purchase ticket first and if you will stack in the queue you are risking to be late for the tour. Then you will not be able to enter till the next tour  which will be in 2 hours . There are also free guided tours for buildings parts   which is nice because otherwise you will be just looking on many empty buildings.',\n",

       " ' Smaller than the main Gyeongbokgung palace If you ve been to Gyeongbokgun palace  Changdeokgung is probably something you can skip if you re in a hurry. Changdeokgung is smaller and has more traditional housing. It is very similiar in terms of structure  the look etc... i liked the long walk towards the main palace  on the left  as many korean drama has that. If you re into korean history  then I would recommend to visit. If not  it probably won t be that interesting exciting.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful and historic  not much to see in the gardens in the winter Had a few hours to kill so I went to the Changdeokgung Palace to walk around. Went on the garden tour which was muddy and not very interesting. The walking areas are sandy dirt  so plan accordingly as your shoes will be a mess when you leave. It had rained snowed a few days before my visit and the grounds were not in great shape. Worth going  but probably much nicer in spring and summer. I would not pay extra for the garden tour in the winter as there is not much to see.',\n",
       " ' Found this palace quite uplifting The setting is beautiful with the gardens and trees. The palace is set according to the topography and is focused on harmony. So it wa out of the norm. Winter is a good time to go and you may see many young people in traditional clothing on a Sunday. ',\n",
       " ' Nice in Spring time I had a lovely day out at Changdeokgung Palace. I got the palace combo ticket which allows entry into a few palaces in Seoul and a Shrine. So if you re wanting to visit a few I would recommend getting the combo. I think this attraction is best visited in Spring time because the gardens in the palace look beautiful during these months. It s also sunny  warm days and blue skies so probably the best time for a long walk around the palace and gardens. This palace has the secret gardens which are lovely. It s a great palace to visit for nice walks and good photos ops. ',\n",

       " ' Seeking for a quiet well known palace? This is the place. Changdeokgung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung  but this palace is more quiet in terms of tourist flow than Gyeongbokgung. If you come early on the morning  you hear the birds singing and hear the nice sound of the wind  so if you are a nature lover this is your spot. The entrance admission is 3000 KRW  3 USD   so it is the same as Gyeongbokgung. Overall  this is my favorite Korean palace  not only because it is a World Heritage  but because it has a good blend of being for tourists and locals. Also  the architecture is more trendy and the palace itself has a more clear path to look around. Good location  located around 5 minutes from the Anguk metro station. TIP  Closed on Mondays. It may get busy on Tuesdays  because Gyeongbokgung is closed on that day.',\n",

Had a guidded tour in English of the Palace  aprox. 45 minutes  and another tour of the Secret Garden  aprox. 1h30  . Tours are free  guides were very interesting  just be sure to be there for the English Tour  there are a couple a day only . The venue is not as crowded as Gyongbokgung Palace. ',\n",
       " ' Another lovely palace to visit. If you are staying in Seoul for a few days or weeks you are best buying the multi ticket for 5 of the palaces and entry to the secret garden. Again there are free guided tours that are well worth the money of the entrance fee. But be aware  if you have the multi ticket you still have to queue up to exchange the ticket you have for an entrance ticket. Like the other palaces a lot of the buildings are new representations of what used to be there but there are some original ones. The signs against all of the buildings explain their purposes well too. No food is allowed to be taken into Changdeokgung Palace and there is nowhere to purchase any food of any kind. There is a tea shop but it does only sell tea and coffee. Great tea but no nibbles. ',\n",

The guards are dressed in ancient style finery and allow you to have pictures taken with them. Inside  you walk through one palace to another and can take photos of the interiors  which are dazzling. It s especially nice to do this on a day with good weather as it requires quite a lot of walking outdoors.',\n",
       " ' LONG Tour and lots of waiting We enjoyed our time there but it was a very long day. They only have three English tours per day of the Secret Garden area. You re only allowed to see those 75 acres during a tour. If you are not physically fit  this part may not be the place for you. It involves lots of walking  most up hills or stairs. It was 90 minutes long and we had to wait 3 hours before the tour began  we walked around the  castle  and its surrounding buildings. It was interesting if you re a history buff like my husband. I definitely don t recommend it with children. ',\n",

One of the 5 Main palaces in Seoul  the different pavillions have been restored after several fires   but they say  very similar as they were before  and have very colorful decorations. I recalled one in particular  with its roof with beautiful Blue tiles..... splendorous! And the paintings in the Hall of the throne...  amazing! At the end of March  the Cherry trees were NOT yet in full bloom  only a few of them  son I would recommend you to visit this outstanding site in the first or second week of April.

Unfortunately  we missed the free English guide to this palace  so our information was limited to those written on the boards located outside the buildings. But since I m a fan of periodic dramas  I was able to roughly put together a nice story for my family ... though there were complains about my version    We were too late for the Secret Garden  but we did not mind it since it is still winter  so most of the trees are still bare. I definitely recommend a visit here .... it s not Seoul if you did not visit the palaces.',\n",

       " ' See the Palace and the Secret Gardens This Palace gives you two visits for the price of one  well  not really   you need to buy a ticket to see the secret garden too   so if you can only fit in one Palace in Seoul  this one might be for you. However  it is also right next door to Changgyeonggung Palace too  with an adjoining entry  so you might squeeze that one in too. We bought a combined ticket  which covered all four Palaces  the secret garden  and Jongmyo Shrine  and saved us money. Be sure you check opening hours   the Palaces and Shrine are not open every day. The Palace at Changdeokgung   you can walk around that by yourself  or go on a guided tour  do some research  as this doesn t apply year round . It has toilets and a caf  and pretty gardens without having to go into the secret gardens. When we were there  the last week of March  2016   the blossoms were just starting to come out on the trees   in one or two weeks time  it would have been sensational! As regards the secret gardens  a tour needs to be booked  and they do it in Korean  Japanese  Chinese or English at various times of the day . We arrived about half an hour before the first English tour  11 30am   and it was already fully booked  so immediately booked the next one at 1 30pm. Note  there are good coffee and food shops in the vicinity! . So you can t go into the secret garden without a guide. The guide stops in about 4 places  explains them  and then gives you about 10 minutes to wander around by yourself. The  secret  aspect to  the secret garden  is that only the King and his mates could enter them. There s some pretty pagodas and other buildings for resting  eating and cooking  King s gotta eat!   water features  and gardens. And also a couple of relatively steep slopes in case you were wondering. All very pretty.',\n",

Interesting short and different shaped doors  sections of the palace and quarters for their staff. How many people used to live there?   uhhhmm. It is quite a walk  so be prepared to wear comfortable shoes and recommend doing this in the morning when it is less warm hot. It s a shame they cordoned off going inside the rooms for a better look up close  but I guess the government has its reason for doing so. Famous sites including their theme park Everland via train subway is doable  make sure you ask for directions on what train to take and inform them of your destination and ask if the place is open on that particular day. Plan your trips so you can maximize to see the sites once you are in a certain area in South Korea specially if you are there for a short stay like us   5 days 4 nights..',\n",
       " ' Peaceful visit We decided to visit this palace instead of Gyeongbokgung mainly so we could visit the Secret Garden. The palace itself is not that large.

If you like architecture then this is for you.',\n",
       " ' Interesting secret garden to explore If you have been to gyeongbukgong  you might feel that this is just another palace. However  this palace has a different feel from that of gyeongbukgong. It feels less imposing. To me  the main attraction was the rear garden of the palace. It s a little oasis right in the middle of Seoul city! Be sure to book the tour of the rear garden beforehand or to arrive in time for the guided tour of the secret garden. It s a long but enjoyable walk. Good walking shoes are definitely recommended!',\n",

They are very strict with the timing so do arrive 20 minutes before the tour time. We were 10 minutes earlier and we had to join the next session. It was early Spring time and the flowers hasn t bloomed so the secret garden wasn t at its prettiest. The place is very mystical  scenic and calming  ZEN. Our tour guide was super sassy  entertaining in a way. There ll be alot of walking so make sure you re in proper walking shoes! ',\n",

We brought tickets for the palace and gardens when we arrived in the afternoon but because of the afternoon garden tour time we didn t get a chance to see the palace. We found the garden disappointing during our visit in late March. There was not much colour. Maybe it looks more attractive at other times of the year?

The trees was so nice and the short explore was a much do in Korea.',\n",
       " ' Gorgeous Gardens This site is great for history and nature lovers. I highly recommend going on the guided tour of the gardens. Otherwise  you ll only see a fraction of what this palace has to offer.',\n",

       " ' Historic site attempts to come alive When I arrived at the site there was an hour left till the 1 30pm English tour. So to avoid the possible crowd I started to checkout the place and take photos. The size of palace is miniature compare to all others  which makes this one ideal as an  introduction  or  summary  of korea s nearest historical governance. My tour guide  Tian  knows the history well and is able to answer my questions about the palace  Korean history  and the emperor family. She was able to condense the tour to 30min for me to witness the guard exchange presentation at the gate by 2pm. Yes I recommend this place.',\n",
       " ' Most beautiful royal palace in Seoul To enjoy this marvelous palace  I recommend a guided tour which not only adds to the enjoyment but also provides many hidden stories of this palace and how it all ties to the history of Korea. Even without the tour guide  the ground is gorgeous and you can get lost several hours in there. If I were to choose one royal palace to visit in Seoul  this would be the one.',\n",

       " ' Amazing place! Consider that it was built in 1386 Our Viator guide was excellent. Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking. The  changing of the guards  is a bit hokey as there is no one to guard anymore but it is still something to see. The ingenuity of the Koreans to  invent  central heat was pretty neat. I can only imagine that the entire grounds will be covered in flowers within a few months.',\n",
       " ' A Must See! Now this is a palace! Like many things in Seoul  Changdeokgung is quite easy to get to by public transport. Korean architechture is very distinct and these structures won t disapoint.',\n",
       " ' Huge place We only visited one palace during our trip to Korea. The area is huge and we spent lots of time just taking in all the grandeur. It s easy to reach the place by public transportation. Since we booked at a nearby place  it was a pleasant three minute walk to this palace. Our 7 year old had a grand time running around and pretending to be palace guard.',\n",

There are several excellent free tours conducted in English offered throughout the day which last approximately one hour and are well worth planning your visit around. When you re done with the palace  head right next door to Bukchon Hanok for lunch. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays.',\n",

       " ' One of the best spots to visit in seoul If you want to indulge yourself with historic events when you travel Seoul  do not forget to include Changdeokgung Palace in your itinerary. It is surprising how they preserved the Palace after hundreds of years. The vibrant details of the roofs  the cornerstones  even the passageways remain the same as it was before. The place is so huge you d get tired to tour around it for just one day  but it s definitely rewarding if you do. Let your imagination play the game while you are in Changdeokgung Palace!',\n",
       " ' Beautiful We visited Changdeokgung Palace on a whim as it was nearby our guesthouse  and we also woke up a bit late and missed the changing of guards at Gyeongbokgung. We had no regrets. We visited on the last Wednesday of the month and got free entrance into the palace  though still needed to pay for the Huwon entrance . The place provides free guided tours at the entrance. Just find the language you want and go ahead and join it  if you haven t already pre booked a tour . Didn t join the Huwon tour though coz we were catching a train to the outskirts. Anyway  it s true. The palace is lovely in winter with snow scattered on the pathways.   ',\n",
       " ' The Secret Garden The Palace highlight is its Secret Garden. The Architecture was great but the Garden stole the show. Magnificently quiet and calm. It will give you a glimpse on how the Korean royals spend their time inside this beautiful but enclose structure.',\n",
       " ' Historic landmark in seoul korea When I went I got to see the changing of the guard ceremony. It was very epic and took about 15 20 mins to complete. Got some cool photos and videos. The guard where traditional ceremonial warrior garb and stand motionless and still out in front of the entrance to the palace. It s pretty cool that they still carry the tradition. The palace is very impressive. It s so big you can barely take a picture of it. Definitely check it out.',\n",
       " ' Go for the secret garden tour This palace isn t as grand as GBK but the secret garden tour was worth a visit. Lots of history and symbolism in the architecture. We went on Christmas day so it was cold and trees were bare so can imagine how pretty it will be in Spring or Autumn. ',\n",
       " ' Must visit in Spring Summer A beautiful palace in Seoul. It is open all year round for tours. I highly recommend visiting the site in Spring or Summer and taking the Secret Garden guided tour  check times and languages ahead of time! . It was nice in winter but would obviously be orders of magnitude better in summer. ',\n",
       " ' A place in history Good place to visit to view the old palace from the bygone time. I didn t visit the secret garden  only the palace ground which was not too big.',\n",
       " ' Culture and history Stunning architecture. English tours available at 1030 and 1430 daily. Adjoins the Changgeongung Palace  which requires a separate ticket to be bought. Note that the Secret Garden  which forms 60  of the palace grounds  closes at 3pm  so plan to arrive much earlier to allow plenty of time to explore. Also if you plan to rent an audio guide  you are required to leave a passport or photo ID. ',\n",
       " ' Secret garden is a must see I visited Changdeokgung Palace in Dec. and was amazed by the secret garden. Although leaves on the trees are all fallen  the buildings are stills pretty amazing. Tourists are only allowed to go into the garden at certain time with the guided tour. The tour guide was very helpful and really explained the idea behind each building and their layout. Tour is around 1.5hrs and basically hiking up and down the hill  because the garden was built on a small hill. The guide also recommended us to come back in the autumn. The palace will be much more colorful than it is in the winter.',\n",
       " ' Has its charms A bit smaller than Gyeongbokgung Palace  but still beautiful and impressive. Less tourists for those who enjoy silence. ',\n",
       " ' Worth the walk Charming palace for a quick visit. Worth walking through the contemporary art museum on the grounds.',\n",
       " ' A good visit while in Seoul but not a reason to visit A good morning and some history to mix with everything else but not overwhelmed. Easy to get to though and close to Insadong',\n",
       " ' Good Place To visiti with a guide. This is a good place to visit specially for people who has interests in local history and culture. I was amazed by how they manage to restore and maintain the facade  color and architectural integrity.',\n",
       " ' Great complement to the Gyeongbokgung Palace If you have the time  do both the Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The Changdeokgung Palace showcases palace grounds in harmony with nature  while the Gyeongbokgung showcases the grandeur and of the palace structures and its symmetrical order. Going on the tour of the Piwon Secret Gardens was a highlight  touring through the beautiful landscape around the hilly grounds. It is highly advised to book the 90 minute tour in advance  as each tour only accommodates 50 and is usually sold out  at least for the English and Korean language versions.',\n",
       " ' Near train station I came across this palace while trying to locate cheongyecheon. Just a short distance from train station. There is a palace guard changing ceremony here and you can check from the net on the time. We can also try the joseon era clothing here for free and take pictures with the palace guards. But pls  do not intimidate the guards  they are humans too. ',\n",
       " ' A beautiful palace on a freezing day The palace is well preserved and there are free tours to guide you round. Due to the cold temperatures  we decided to self your to cut the time. I was disappointed that you could not enter any of the buildings however there was information in English almost everywhere. Staff were helpful and polite. There are toilets a a cafe should you need them. We did not enter the second area as you could only do so on a guided tour and this lasted 90 minutes. It was too cold for us to stand around!',\n",
       " ' Never gets old This is a place I visited for the 2nd time. It is still fascinating to visit this palace again! Those who watch alot of korean drama should at least visit this place for once.',\n",
       " ' Best Palace Best of the palaces within Seoul and easily combined with a wander round Bokcheon village. Don t miss the BiWon  Secret Garden . It is an extra W3000 but well worth the guided only tour. Don t wait for a specific language tour since the tour guides are very dry and just spew endless dates and facts  just take the nearest time to your arrival. I have been more than a dozen times with friends and family and it still impresses ',\n",

       " ' A garden worth seeing... We visited Changdeokgung Palace because the other Palace was closed. It was quite a surprise to see the many different buildings and their uses especially the heating system under the flooring. The Secret Garden was the highlight of the garden tour which I would recommend to visitors.',\n",
       " ' I wish I had a Summer Palace A beautiful palace full of history and stories. We had an english speaking guide who told us the history of the palace and I have a personal guide with me who told me the love story of the king and prince  etc. The palace was partially destroyed but restored later hence some of the heritage is quite modernized. But there more of the palace that are still original and you can still appreciate the beauty of the buliding and the creativity of the craftmens. Somehow it didn t give me the sense of labor intensity when I walked around the palace unlike the Summer Palace in Beijing. I enjoyed walking around the palace...and it s worth the 2 3 hours spend there.',\n",

       " ' UNESCO Heritage This charming palace is UNESCO heritage sight. Make sure you pay extra for guided tour. This palace is located right next to other attraction such as Hanok village which will only take 15 to 20 min. walk.',\n",
       " ' The prettiest one This palace is the one I could live in. It has all the elements of other palaces  but if you miss to visit it  you will regret it for sure. It s special because even though it s smaller than Gyeongbokgung  the grandiose first palace  it has such a pleasant peaceful feeling and a secret garden that makes it even more special. It s definitely worth the entrance fee and the time. Also  wear comfortable shoes. I wore newly bought ones and ended up walking the whole secret garden tour barefoot. Don t forget the bottled water either!! It s a life saver. Advice  buy a ticket for all three palaces at once  10000 . And do visit all of them. Every palace has it s own charm. You won t regret.',\n",
       " ' Nothing special There are better places in Seoul  like the Buddhist temple in Gangnam . The palace itself looks nice but it s empty and  new . If you ve been in China and Japan you will find this place worthless. ',\n",

       " ' free and easy at Seoul Secret garden is a must when you visit this palace. The scenery is very beautiful at the secret garden but a lot of walking to do with 1and half hours of guided tours.',\n",
       " ' Hey Our guide was apparently a fan of PSY  which we found to be hilarious. Anyway  the narrow passages of this palace were very interesting to walk through  although the palace itself is not that different from the rest. Huwon  Secret Garden  is probably a lot more beautiful in spring summer  but it was still nice to walk through. While the free guided tours are a great way to encourage tourists to learn about Korean history  I do think that the guided tour of the garden is too long. One hour is more than enough to cover this part of the attraction  it takes 90 minutes   especially considering the fact that joining a guided tour is the only way one can see the garden.',\n",
       " ' The History of South Korea Great historical place to go sight seeing  the number of figures on the top of the roof represents the importance of the building.',\n",

       " ' Classic Palace Don t miss the secret garden. An extra ticket but well worth it. We were there on the peak foliage week and the trees were magnificent. ',\n",
       " ' Great history So beautiful to see the royal buildings and get to know how it used to be before Japanese invasion for 35yrs which cleansed a lot of their history. I saw the guard change still done the way used to be. A must ... It s a travel in time',\n",
       " ' Good fun for entire family! I went here with my wife and a 4 years old. We all enjoyed being here. In fact  we think this is more enjoyable than the main palace. The secret garden was very nice even in the winter. It s very peaceful and the tour guide gave us plenty of time to explore and took photos. It was especially nice given there are few people in the group so it was more like a private tour for us. Not sure if that was because we went during winter time  we were there near Christmas . Just make sure to dress warm! We will definitely come again during warmer season',\n",
       " ' Nice visit Rich history and beautiful architectural design! The grounds are very clean  however  I m concerned the inside of the palace are exposed to the elements. ',\n",
       " ' Family vacation Good experience to see the structure design of the palace. Quite big and therefore have to do a bit of walking. ',\n",
       " ' Lovely way to pass some time. Interesting place to visit  very cheap  I think 100 won each. Wear trainers as it s quite a big site. Toilet facilities are available.',\n",
       " ' Relaxing place You can take a subway to this place  or if you stay near Jongno gu  you can walk. I recommend to visit this place in the morning as there are not many tourirts  and you can experience a peaceful time',\n",
       " ' Not very exciting! We did not find this palace very exceiting after having visited the Forbidden City in Beijing. Its very similar in design. We saw the change of guard ceremony  which was the only interestting thing during our visit.',\n",
       " ' Best Palace in Seoul Even though Gyeongbokgung get s recommended as the best palace most of the time  I prefer Changdeokgung with it s unique tour through the palace garden  also called  Secret Garden  . I think I finally managed to see the garden in all 4 seasons and all of them have their own charms.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful and rich in history. Beautiful place. Historic palace in Seoul. Rich in history. Many different buildings many of which were hand painted beautifully made.. Definitely worth checking out while in Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Really don t miss the Secret Garden We wanted to visit because it s a UNESCO World Heritage Site  but what we really enjoyed was the Huwon or Secret Garden. General admission ticket to Changdeokgung lets you wander around the main buildings of the Palace. To see the Huwon Secret Garden  you have to join the compulsory tour with a separate ticket  ticket combines general admission and tour . The  garden  is really the natural surroundings and wooded area that covers more than half of the Changdeokgung complex. The tour lasts 90 minutes so wear comfortable walking shoes. Also  check for Huwon tour times and what language you want  Korean  English  Chinese  Japanese  and time your visit accordingly to avoid disappointment. The Huwon Secret Garden is beautiful in how it was built to blend harmoniously with its natural surroundings. Buildings  pavilions  ponds and gardens are designed around the geography of the land and landscaping is minimal  a stark contrast to the typical palace complex which adopts a grid like plan. As beautiful as the gardens are  it s also rich in history. Your guide will also furnish you with the history of each structure and its purpose  be it library  study  contemplation or banquet. Overall  Changdeokgung was a more serene palace complex  we wandered around the main buildings and encountered less tourists than elsewhere. And maybe it s because we like history and nature  but the Huwon Secret Garden tour made this place a must see during our visit to Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Looking back in time It was a bright sunny minus 18 degrees celsius day when I wandered through the grounds of Changdeokgung Palace. You can t help but pause and consider how small and insiginifcant one individual is when contemplating the life of Kings as you peer into their accomodations and take in the palace grounds  some dating back to late 1300 s early 1400 s. The great thing about this Palace was being able to wander and discover all by ourselevs but also the hidden gems we found around corners that could be easily over looked. Take your time and enjoy one of Korea s national treasures and UNESCO listed sites. The entry fee is amazingly small!',\n",
       " ' Great Historic Palace Awesome to see a huge historic palace is preserved in middle of the busy city  great history and makes you feel you are time travelling back to history!',\n",

It was smaller than the other palaces  but that isn t saying much because this was huge still  I loved it for the natural beauty. It was breath taking. There was a little pond that you would surely miss if you didn t look for it and it was covered in green lily pads. We watched two ducks roam around the waters. This place was a gem in industrial Seoul!',\n",
       " ' In love Place time and art are amazing. In this huge modern world peace of history is standing and waiting to be explored. Palace is amazing garden looks wonderful and show was breathtaking. Worth going ',\n",
       " ' Winter visit This Palace is easily reachable by underground or taxi. Most beautiful trees with red leaves mixing other pine trees were all bald at winter time  so it not as colourful as it is in pictures shot in autumn. All buildings were the same and very plain  may interested those architectural lovers. We attempted to pay fee for the secret garden which must be entered with a tour guide but unfortunately one only time with a chinese tour guide on sunday  for the whole day  can you imagine how interested it can be. The palace charge extra money to enter the secret garden but the service is so limited and travellers take so much time to go there. Tour guides in English is also limited. And I did not think I saw any timetable for the secret garden at the main entrance  may be it is a little secret that should not tell travellers. The ticket seller  probably has limited english ability and will just answer the money you need to pay but nothing else. So if you go  it would be better to enquire the tour guide time for the secret garden if you do not want to miss the boat. ',\n",

       " ' Timeless Glory Beauty enriched by time. Walking through the palace grounds gives the visitor a sense of ancient Korea especially if you are a fan of Korean period dramas. The entrance is a massive gate adorned with colourful patterns and carvings on wood. Ticket is very reasonable especially if you buy the combination ticket for the five grand palaces of Seoul. This ticket includes the secret garden in this palace as well which I recommend you to see but once you reach the pavilion with the pond where the souvenir shop is you may stop there because the rest will be a long walk with tree lined uphill path and some more pavilion  nothing else. The Injeongjeon Hall is the throne hall of the palace. There are also small buildings which good picture backgrounds with less people like the Huijeongdang Hall. A map of the palace is essential.',\n",

The gardens surrounding this palace are vast and worth visiting as well  so bring good walking shoes.

Tickets can be bought onsite in a small ticket booth.',\n",

You have to buy a separate ticket or pay for both palace grounds and biwon together. The garden was really interesting and beautiful but understand you ll be walking uphill a lot and can only go during a tour. They don t allow people to wander around by themselves. I dislike tours groups but there was nothing I could do. If you have a lot of time to sightsee around Seoul  try all the palaces. If your time is limited  pick either this one or gyeongbukgung  which is a few blocks away ...it s not worth cramming both into one trip to Seoul. IMO  I would pick gyeongbukgung since you also have the option of visiting 2 museums on the palace grounds as well as lockers to stash your bags. Also  5 line lets you out right under the entrance.',\n",

We were there in late gloomy March and could only see few branches of cherry blossom. Be there at the right season to really appreciate its beauty!. Getting there is easy   about 400m walk from the Orang Line 3 Anguk Station. Entrance fee is 3 000KRW for just the Palace visit. Add another 5 000KRW if you want to visit the Secret Garden. Don t miss the Secret Garden as it is more interesting. Join the 90mins free tour to get a better understanding of the Secret Garden. This Garden is bigger than the Palace proper. You could also join a night tour of the Garden through advance booking. Happy Walking!!! After the Palace visit  you could visit the nearby Bukchon to see the picturesque hanoks.',\n",

Visit the secret garden it is well worth it. Tour takes an hour and a half. No food allowed but you can buy water half way round. It is a bit hilly but worth the trek. Make sure you leave enough time for your first tour and the secret garden. You reserve as specific time for the secret garden. Also the traffic was bad so if you are travelling by taxi leave enough time. Well worth the visit  a small piece of history in the centre of this modern city',\n",
       " ' Good palace 10 minutes away by taxi from our hotel Myeongdong area  we purchased royal palace which we can use for several palace  secret garden was included.. worth a walk',\n",
       " ' Very Interesting Tour Never visited this palace before especially for my husband  daughter and son in law neve had a chance to see what is Korea or Asia. They only knew from the TV and megazines. It was very educational and opening visitor s eyes to different time and culture. I enjoyed for my family.',\n",
       " ' Little bit of culture The palace itself is disappointing  but the secret garden is amazing. The garden is extensive and the tour is available in English. Personally found the tour to be a little crowded. Would have preferred to spend some quite time in the gardens instead.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Secret Garden The best part if this palace that distinguished it from the others is the Secret Garden. When we went there  the Secret Garden is only accessible via group guided tours and we are not allowed to wander off on our own in order to ensure the garden is well preserved. We booked for the guided English tour online before we flew to Seoul. Our lady guide was excellent  her English command is very good and at each place she would tell us the history and story behind the spots that we visited. Normally every year during Spring  they would also have night tours to the garden. Do note that the guided night tour is only open for foreigners an only available on 1 day or max 2 days per month   I think they chose the nights with full moon . Among the 5 palaces  I would recommend this palace to visit other than Gyengbokgung.',\n",
       " ' A Duplicate to Gyeongbokgung Palace I believe you do not need to visit Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. They are pretty much the same  though the tour we took at Gyeongbokgung Palace was better. The best part of Changdeokgung Palace was The Secret Garden. You can take the tour of The Palace  and then take the tour of The Secret Garden. The Palace tours in English are at 10 30AM and 2 30pm  the Garden is at 11 30  1 30 and 3 30',\n",
       " ' A must do. With the secret garden! This is a beautiful palace. I would highly recommend arriving early to be able to see the secret garden which gets fully booked really quickly.',\n",
       " ' One of the main palaces in Seoul Great tour...very interesting history. Our tour guide communicated some very interesting facts. Covers alot of ground and the decor was beautiful. ',\n",
       " ' Expansive Palace Took the tour of the palace and then booked the secret garden tour as well which was really special and some interesting ponds and gardens to see along the way. Well worth the trip.',\n",
       " ' Historical palace that was modernized with electricity in the 1920s. This palace was modified in the the 1920s by the King to include electricity and our guide showed us ramps that the King had built to accommodate his car and the Queen s car. Though a UNESCO World Heritage Site  the modernization  though not readily apparent  rather ruins the historical perspective. Still  interesting to visit.',\n",
       " ' Best palace in Seoul thanks to the amazing secret garden I agree with the guidebook this is the best palace in Seoul. The highlight is the beautiful secret garden. The garden is nice in winter but on my return in Spring  I was amazed at how lovely it is. The landscaping is amazing and the tour guide will add some good information  the quality of tour guides varies the first in winter was great  the second in spring was OK but less interesting . Free tours are given of the palace but I the guide was not interesting for this tour I think he was inexperienced. The palace area itself is nice but remember that palaces in South Korea are more simple when compared to German palaces. Those that visited Germany will find the contrast interesting.',\n",
       " ' Nice Place at the outskirt of the city I went their in May 2016 from India. The place had an temp of around 24 degree Celsius. for me it was like waaoww... Nice palace in mountains with a beautiful scenery around. it is a small half and hour drive from Seoul city and an ideal place to spend your evening.',\n",
       " ' Interesting We booked in advance for the Palace and Secret Garden English guided tours. Both guides were informative and engaging. It was a hot day and we were quite exhausted after 2.5 hours but nonetheless a interesting break from all the shopping in Seoul. ',\n",
       " ' Enchanting Palace Wear a hanbok and get free entry to the palace! We enjoyed taking pictures in the palace. A must do is go online to book a guided tour to the secret garden. Although we had to pay for this but it is worth the time and money to enter this part of the palace.',\n",
       " ' Nice cultural sight Due to various korean soap operas that I ve watched  I was really interested in these special castles. It is a huge symbol of the pure korean or far east architecture. Fantastic garden in shape of a jungle with an awesome lake in the heart of it. Totally the environment is unbelievably soothing and relaxing. The main problem was its accessibility  public transportation is not really around the area and it took 30 minutes for us to get there from a subway station. ',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden Tour is Worth it! The garden in the palace is natural and beautiful. Felt so relax and could easily spend half a day strolling around myself. We did the walking tour which was great to get some insights on the history. ',\n",
       " ' Nice scenery It good to view and learn from others  especially  the history and culture. Worth to take a walk and enjoy the scenery.',\n",
       " ' Peace and quiet...sort of Another nice place to be getting out of the hustle and bustle of the city but you have to elbow your way past the throngs of tourists  especially the tour groups getting guided tours.',\n",
       " ' it was good. I don t know why I wasn t really impressed by palaces overall  it s an average place to see and take pictures.',\n",
       " ' My preferred palace to visit! I prefer Changdeokgung Palace over Gyeongbokgung Palace. This palace is lovely  I enjoyed the Secret Garden Tour  Paid for  with my family. The english speaking tour guide was excellent  speaking in clear English and giving great details of the history of the palace. Overall  an enjoyable trip here.',\n",
       " ' Interesting historical palace There is a free guide service inside the palace. A signboard shows the timings. The guide provided us with lot of interesting facts about the palace. It was one hour of guidance. ',\n",
       " ' Beautifuk Palace fitting into the landscape We took the Secret Garden tour with a knowledgeable English speaking guide. There are a lot of people who do this tour so I would suggest one to be early as they are punctual. A walk through this Joseon dynasty palatial grounds gives insight into the ways of the Korean royals. The secret garden covers a lot of the palatial grounds with many intricate and unique pavilions and ponds. The setting of these structures was done with much harmony with the landscape. A visit to this palace is absolutely worth it.',\n",
       " ' Lovely place not overrun with tourists I was very pleasantly surprised to visit this beautiful palace and to not have to share it with throngs of other people as I would have had to in the main palace a short distance away.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful gardens There is a lot of walking but it s worth it. No food allowed so eat before you come. Water only. This is my favorite of the 5 Seoul palaces. The garden tour was a beautiful hike. Please make sure your camera is fully charged and you wear bug spray and sunscreen! You might want to take a lot of garden pictures. ',\n",
       " ' Just like everything in South Korea this was amazing to see This is a place that was was overwelmeming   the structure was amazing  not unlike many places of worship in Asia',\n",
       " ' Magical Moonlight Tour at Changdeokgung Palace Changdeokgung Palace offers a moonlight tour of the palace grounds for foreigners during the summer months on full moon nights. We booked the tour months in advance and it was worth every penny. The palace is beautiful but the only way to see the private  secret  gardens is to book a tour. We started the tour at the entrance gates where we were met by people dressed in traditional clothing. We were able to take pictures and then the tour began. We carried battery operated lanterns as we explored the grounds. Building and trees were lit so it was easy to navigate. As we walked the palace  performers played traditional instruments and folk songs in the background. It was quite romantic and magical to hear the music and imagine yourself wondering the grounds in dynasty times. The tour lead to a performance stage where traditional sweets and plum or cinnamon tea was served. We then watched several traditional performances that were beautiful. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and earpieces were provided so it was very easy to hear while on the tour. This is defiantly worth the money and it is must see in Korea. There is a lot of walking involved on the tour so wear comfortable shoes.',\n",
       " ' Just like you see it in the Korean serials.. The experience is surreal.. walking through the palace with our guide Matt explaining the different Dynasty  Kings and what happened during each eras is like having a history lesson! The beauty of the Palace is it s not ostentatious but does tell the story! Definitely worth a visit!',\n",
       " ' Korean hystirical palace a collection of several palaces with traditional Korean design. there are a wide area of different buildings from king palaces  queen palaces  offices  kitchen and so on. they were made of wood and cover by beautiful colors. its like a dream! you lost in history. behind the palace you see a green park and lake. also you find some museum here too.',\n",
       " ' Amazing Changdeokgung Palace is huge! When entering the palace  you would get the feel of the Jeoson era. You could imagine the Royalties walking through the corridors of the palace dressed in their royal garbs. Inside Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden  only accessible for when you join a tour. I would suggest to join the tour as it would give you more insight about the history of the garden and why it s given a special place.',\n",
       " ' Average site with little to see   and I miised the Huwon gardens One person s opinion  I have seen better Asian palaces. Changdeokgung also known as Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Seoul. It is one of the  Five Grand Palaces  built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty  but I do not think it was grand. This visit was part of a cruise ship 2 place tour  we booked it because we were afraid to take cabs from the Incheon port to the palace in Seoul   because of traffic. There was a lot of traffic  for sure  but there was no time saving on a bus vs. a private cab. I would take a private cab from Incheon port into the palace  if I could do this journey again. Missed it  I did not see the Huwon gardens and I did not know it even existed. Behind the palace lies the 78 acre garden which was originally constructed for the use of the royal family and palace women. The garden incorporates a lotus pond  pavilions  and landscaped lawns  trees  and flowers. There are over 26 000 specimens of a hundred different species of trees in the garden and some of the trees behind the palace are over 300 years old. This was not part of the cruise ship tour  but should be part of any new tour.',\n",
       " ' Spectacular by Night I visited the palace as part of my conference tour group. The Ministry of Tourism had made a special arrangement for my group to see the palace at night. It was a wonderful moonlight tour and even some of the Koreans in my group were so pleased because they had never visited this place at night. We were even treated to special cultural shows  which gave me a good appreciation for the rich and diverse Korean culture.',\n",
       " ' all outside so wear a hat Somehow I thought a palace would be an inside tour. Not this one. It is all outside and on a hot day there is little shade. Since it is central you have to expect traffic snarls to get there.',\n",
       " ' Go for the secret garden tour The general palace area is nice and sprawling  and on the weekday that i went  I could find places that were relatively quiet. When I arrived  I pondered a bit over whether to spring extra for the garden tour and I m glad I did. I can see why they need it to be guided as it s a wide open space with a few built up areas connected by paths. Letting people roam freely around historical buildings with little supervision would be way trouble. it can get crowded with the tour throng but the uniqueness of the pavilions makes it worthwhile.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace! Very historically interesting  as well as beautiful! Lovely gardens  designed to complement the natural landscape. Good restaurants nearby.',\n",
       " ' Time very well spent! The philosophy of Confusius comes alive when you visit this beautiful Palace complex. We took a taxi from our hotel and took the English language tour  taxis are a bargain in Seoul . A Japanese colleague with us noticed that the Japanese language guide made no mention of the Japanese having once burnt this Palace.',\n",
       " ' Should have spent more time there Had reached the palace in the late afternoon. It is quite accessible  walking distance from Angguk subway station. About 5 to 10 mins walk. As it was spring time  the flowers are in full bloom  it was quite a sight to behold. Quite a different experience from that in Gyeonbokgong. Had wanted to visit the secret garden  but was closed by late afternoon. Nevertheless  it was a relaxing place to spend a few hours in. ',\n",
       " ' Historical Beauty The only reason I give it 4 stars  is that like many places in Korea they don t give information or notice about how much walking is required or the terrain. I took my parents here and they loved the rich history  the large spaces  but the walking  especially on a hot day in Seoul can be a lot. Make sure to go into the Palace and see the bench where the King would sit. It still smells musty and the old yellow curtains hang low. The best spot is the Secret Garden  but note this is a long walk with many steep hills and climbing.',\n",
       " ' Magnificent This was a great alternative to the more famous Gyeongbokgung Palace  which was closed on the only day I was in Seoul. The structures around the palace complex are magnificent and well preserved and the guide for my tour gave a lot of good info about the palace and its place in Korean history and culture.',\n",
       " ' Serenity Not as grand as the Gyeongbokgung Palace but a more peaceful and calmer place. Unlike Gyeongbokgung  Changdeokgung wasn t completely destroyed by the Japanese and reconstructed  so it has a special serenity almost palpable. The real draw for me is the Secret Garden tour. This is the rest of the palace complex  about 60  of the total area. You have to book online in advance  and the slots for a tour in English go fast. We were fortunately to get 2 of the last 3 slots for a late morning tour. The Secret Garden tour is quite a long walk across hilly terrain  but what a beautiful place! A royal refuge indeed. Pity the royal tombs were closed to conservation. My advice is to plan ahead and make your booking way in advance  and bring a good pair of hiking shoes.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace Nice place to check out probably can do this in an hour and just check out the main palace without walking around everywhere as it gets a bit boring after an hr. I missed the changing of the guard if you can when the change guards will be a better experience',\n",
       " ' A trip back in time The real star of this place is the Hiwon  secret garden area. It s about a 55 minute tour and be sure to bring good walking shoes. The secret garden tour fills up fast and they offer it to English speakers only a few times a day so come early to get a ticket  an extra cost to the general admission ticket  If you purchase the combination ticket book you just have to show your secret garden part of the book to get a ticket. ',\n",
       " ' Royal Splendor This is where the kings and queens of Korea lived  and around 30  is in original condition. Book a guide and get the story of the travails of the royal family over the centuries.',\n",
       " ' Very huge place to explore by foot Ample space for anyone to snap photo and walkthrough for a historical attraction. FOC and do not have to worry about crowds as the place is really huge!',\n",
       " ' Ancient Korean Architecture My daughter and I visited Changdeokgung Palace during our trip to Seoul. What a beautiful example of Korean History and Architecture. If it wasn t for all the tourists it would be a great place to sit and meditate. Really enjoyed the detail on the roofs and eaves. Take your time and enjoy.',\n",
       " ' Imperial Historical Palace Great UNESCO landmark remarkably preserved in he heart of Seoul. Great glimpse into the imperial court life. I would skip the secret garden tour. ',\n",
       " ' Excellent palace steeped in heritage The palace is steeped with heritage and history and is declared so by UNESCO. The rooms are decorated very well and each room has its purpose of having. The Kings throne and the feast he would have is very interesting to watch. A must visit for all. I went twice to visit',\n",
       " ' Doesn t take too long if your time is limited Because of time limit I could only visit this Palace. I couldn t afford more free time. I could enjoy at least a short aspect of this culture. The secrte garden will remain secret only guided visit is allowed. Again not enough time!',\n",
       " ' Beautiful gardens in tune with the surroundings Sadly most of South Korea has been devastated by wars or fires  so most of the buildings of historical significance have undergone many renovations and rebuilds to present a picture of  old life . The Changdeokgung Palace is a lovely place  which was originally built in 1405. Full restoration work began in 1991 and continue today. Many local young people visit wearing full traditional dress  which gives visitors a chance to take lovely photos.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden is must visit It was a rainy day but we already booked a tour in the Secret Garden. The secret garden tour was totally worth it. There a lot of hiking and walking so wear comfortable shoes. If you are wearing hanbok  can be rent from a shop opposite the palace   you can a free entry to the palace  not the secret garden . It is the best location to do some photoshooting as well. There are only one place where the toilet is in the palace and another one in the secret garden.',\n",
       " ' Pleasant but lacks awe For a royal palace this does seem a little stark  the buildings whilst undoubtedly historic are not noteworthy in themselves the roofing is impressive. Nice gardens at the top to wander around and it is a very peaceful spot. Worth a trip certainly but will not have you swooning in awe. Definitely take the special garden tour  the highlight.',\n",
       " ' Good Palace to visit The palace itself was well kept  and manageable in size to visit. Nothing spectacular if you have already coming from China and went to the Forbidden City  for example  but if this is one of your first palaces  I think is worthy. ',\n",
       " ' A highlight for any Seoul trip You don t need to budget a whole half day here  but certainly make it an early morning or late afternoon stop. A visit is worth cost of admission  and if you like history  try to link up for a guided tour  or at least the audio tour   it s well organized.',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Very beautiful and well kept the Koreans have gone to great detail to preserve what the great kings left. I found every detail worth the visit.',\n",
       " ' Fantastic time We did the Moonlight tour which only happens less than 10 times a year and I must say that the tour was an incredible experience  walking inside the palace at night with the light in the garden ... The secret garden during the night will be my best memory from Seoul. ',\n",
       " ' An interesting and historical palance with Western setting A small palace where you can spend one or two hours. They also have changing guard with two shows a day  check their new schedule first  otherwise you will miss it.. At the entrance  look for some young ladies who are wearing a yellow t shirts. They are students from the local school and they volunteer to be tour guide. This service is free and they are a bunch of friendly and helpful people. Perhaps this is part of their history  so most of them are very knowledgeable with all part of the palace and can walk through each part with you. They are very proficient with English and some times can be humor too. After the tour  it is optional to complete a survey for them and they will bring back to their school. This palace is comparatively small with the Grand Palace  but each section has its own functionality. The secret garden is very beautiful. We are lucky to enter for free because that week was their Golden Week  otherwise  you have to pay Won3000 per person  but the cost is worth for it.',\n",
       " ' Rotary Convention Our annual Rotary International convention was held in Seoul Korea this year. We took a few extra days for sightseeing. This Palace was one of the highlights for me. I love history and I love beautiful things. This inexpensive tour combines both of those. I love the way it Korean culture honors its history. This is a beautiful place to visit without spending too many dollars. You can do the whole thing in an hour or two. I also very much enjoyed the museum adjacent to the Palace. Air conditioned and a nice restaurant inside it was a good diversion in the middle of a hot day. If you can do this with the tour guide it is even better. Too many things that you simply would not understand without having a guide.',\n",
       " ' Nice experience Very similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing... This place is smaller than Forbidden City but the architecture are as elaborate as compared... Good to experience once...',\n",
       " ' Not worth the time We had the English guide take us around the compound. There was one point we had to climb steep slopes. We paid extra for a ticket into the secret garden. More like a peek into history for a day. Won t come again. ',\n",
       " ' Better of the 2 imperial palaces My guide book said this one is the smaller and less impressive of the two imperial palaces. I disagree. The ground seemed bigger  more buildings and a  secret garden . The garden requires a separate ticket but worth the money. As with the  bigger  palace  there are many building that you cannot walk into  just look into. There grounds are more landscaped  even outside of the  secret garden  . If you only have time to go to one palace  go to this one.',\n",
       " ' Don t miss the Secret Garden! The tour of the palace is truly great  but the real gem is the Secret Garden tour. Don  t miss it! You may want to check before hand  so you re not disappointed  but the Secret Garden tour runs only occasionally. You are truly in an oasis in the middle of the beautiful city of Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Disappointing The palace is considerably smaller than Gyeongbok Palace but this was expected since based on the review I read  it is not the main royal palace. One of the reasons my friend and I went to Changdeok Palace was its Secret Garden  as it is one of UNESCO s World Heritage Sites. The way it was advertised was that it is a very splendid and romantic place but the reality was far from it and in my opinion  it is not representative to be a royal garden. Even worse was that we had to pay separate entrance fees for the palace and the garden and that of the garden is more expensive.',\n",
       " ' Cloudy day worth to visit with a guide It was a cloudy day when we visited this palace of the last king of Korea. Luckily we managed to join an english tour  2.30pm to find out more about the history of this palace. We didn t join the secret garden tour  3.30pm as it was kinda drizzling and we don t have any umbrella with us today. The secret garden was where the king spent most of his time together with his most beloved concubine   whom he couldn t make as his first wife as he wasn t allowed to choose his own wife  He built a house for her next to the garden   something unheard apparently   showed how much he loved her  ',\n",
       " ' Grand and interesting The strange history concerning how many times it has been destroyed and rebuilt  portions at least  is fascinating. And from far it looks small but as you approach you see the intricate details and great attention that was laid to each element that makes it so beautiful. There were lots of people  but I found that charming. It was good to have a tour guide to tell us about the nuances of the structures and the layout and some of the stories that make a place so much richer. Not good to go on a rainy day. Worth a visit if you have the time   about 1 30 2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive. If you get a chance walk around the area in the city because there is lots to do there as well  not just sightseeing. ',\n",
       " ' Serene and Beautiful Secret Garden Although the Palace itself is grand and worth visiting  what stood out was the Secret Garden. On a cloudy  breezy afternoon  meandering through the garden was delightful. But as there are only guided tours of the Secret Garden and a limited number of visitors are allowed each day  its best to book in advance. Can be easily done on the Changdeokgung Palace website. There are guided tours in different languages including English and Japanese.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace The main palace is beautiful but you definitely have to visit the Secret gardens. We visited in summer  but I guess the garden will be beautiful in Autumn and Spring. There are only two English tours to the secret Garden in a day and that s a problem. You cannot visit the Secret Garden just by yourself.',\n",
       " ' Lovely Palace and Gardens Allow plenty of time to visit this palace is you are going to do the Secret Garden guided tour  recommended . Bring water and good walking shoes!',\n",
       " ' Nice place If you have time for only one palace in Seoul  go here and do the garden visit  guided tour only and quite long . The palace itself is nice  same architectural design as many palaces and temples in Korea. The gardens have a great serene atmosphere and allow you to see really nice parts of the palace complex.',\n",
       " ' Nice palace This was the only palace I visited in Seoul and I was glad I visited this palace. It was worth it. The palace is not as big as the palaces in Beijing but it is still as beautiful. We met Korean actor Lee Dong Wok who was shooting a korean drama on our way here. He was very friendly and handsome . Overall..make sure you visit this palace and then take a short break at one if the cafes nearby. ',\n",
       " ' Wear sneaker to go up! I didn t think about the trail to get the secret garden so I just used sandal and it was hard  but doable for me because I m pretty good hiker. I figured out this palace style tend to be Korean style which is built base on nature environment. ',\n",
       " ' Colorful but the grounds are bare The colors on the inside of the main temple were impressive but the rest of the grounds were not that impressive. There is a museum right next door  we wandered into it from the palace grounds  that I really enjoyed. If you find that  go in! it s air conditioned. ',\n",
       " ' Nice place This is an interesting place  although not as impressive as those in other Asian countries. It is somewhat maze like  with several building scattered over a wide area. I strongly recommend setting aside at least 3 hours to visit the whole complex.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful buildings We did this as part of a tour  and the place is wonderful. The history and culture of the place is impressive and with a knowledgeable guide is a great way to learn about this wonderful countries history. Great day out.',\n",
       " ' Part of Free transit tour at INC Airport This was on the 5 hr free tour from INC Airport in Korea. As a transit passenger  all you do is show your tkts and most of the 2 3hr tours are free. This one was  10US  but included entrance fees and a very nice lunch. I would highly rec and to book on line or get to airport before 7 30am and get on a waiting list. ',\n",
       " ' Must see palace Out of the 3 palaces I ve seen this one was my favorite  make sure to catch the ceremony at 16 00. There is also an art gallery in the palace. And since it is a smaller palace less people come here so not as crowded.',\n",
       " ' Nice stop for a few hours My wife and I spent a little over 3 hours here including the Secret Garden tour. We guided ourselves through the main palace area using the maps and posted signs. It was very interesting to try and imagine what life was like hundreds of years ago in such a place. The Secret Garden is a very nice add on and is guide led. Our group was rather large  but once you start walking around it seems smaller. The guide was informative but gave us plenty of time to explore each stop. There were some hills involved so be wary if you have trouble walking on inclines. ',\n",
       " ' My Favorite of the Palaces I found Chandeokgung to be the most beautiful of all the palaces  and I visited them all! I took two free English language tours. The first one  a tour of of the buildings and explanation of the history was very hood. The second tour  of the Secret Garden  was only okay. I could barely understand the guide and the Secret Garden was pleasant  but not as impressive as the name conjured. But I was there just before spring  and I suspect it would have been much prettier with the flowers blooming and the trees leafing out. But the palace was  WOW! ',\n",
       " ' Changdeok Palace and The Secret Garden Changdeokgung is the most unique Korean palace built in harmony with landscape. No doubt this is one of the kings of Joseon favorite palace because of the spacious and beautiful Secret Garden. This palace closed on Monday.

Only guided tour are available in the secret garden.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace The palaces were so beautiful but practically enjoyed Changdeokgung because of the spring flowers and Cherry blossoms outside. I can t recommend the Secret Garden tour for those who are not fit or elderly though as it is really a struggle. We went there early April so the trees are still bare and there were only few spring flowers here and there. Still it was a nice experience.',\n",
       " ' Free tours are fantastic Interesting place  be sure to check the website for times of the free tours. They are very interesting and informative.

This palace is full of history and no wonder they sealed off a portion of the palace grounds to general public to preserve its history and architecture. ',\n",

       " ' Hiking in the Palace This is more Korean style palace. That is  it is built according to the nature. The other one   Gyeongbokgung   is more Chinese style which gates and building are all lined up. Even the main gate for this palace is situated in the corner. And they didn t cut down on hills and trees. So it s pretty much of hiking in the city if you take the full course. The palace part is open to everyone except every Mondays  but the secret garden   something more famous   must be reserved beforehand. If you are a small group  there usually are some tickets available at the spot  but I wouldn t risk it. Just reserve it online first. The garden is beautiful and huge and the hills are haha endless. Better wear sneakers. No tough shoes.',\n",
       " ' The most beautiful palace in Seoul Don t miss this one. It s not just another palace  it s the most beautiful one in Seoul. The buildings are incredibly charming.

       " ' Beautiful and empty This Palace is similar  to my eyes!  but nicer than Gyeongbokgung. The buildings are really splendid and the gardens around very pleasant  blossoming these days with zillions of Korean teenagers in traditional costume spending the day to make selfies..... .Overall a similar sense of emptiness is nevertheless also present. These palaces are empty or closed... so despite thence architecture  it s like walking around something you d like to  really  visit but can t. A bit frustrating. Nice place though.',\n",

Lovely atmosphere  also great book  and souvenir shop. Enjoyed a good cup of tea here  too. Don t miss the Secret Garden  which makes up most of the space behind the buildings. You need to go on a guided tour  English is offered  to enter. You can get the tickets together with your general tickets or at the booth just before the entry to the Garden.The Garden is not suitable for wheelchairs!',\n",
       " ' Nice guided tour Guided tour is very informative. Since the secret garden is very large  you want to follow a guide. It is recommended to book the tour ahead as this is very popular. If you start the tour at 3 30  the last tour   you won t have enough time to see the buildings. So plan to see the buildings first before you to go to the secret garden. After walking around the garden you will be too tired too!',\n",
       " ' don t take the Secret Garden tour if you are not fit! The palace was pretty nice. This was the only palace I visited in Seoul so I have no other comparisons. One strong word of advice is that if you are not fit  elderly  need assistance with walking  or you have toddlers  prams and such  do not take the  Secret Garden tour . Before the tour started  we heard someone ask the palace tour guide if there were a lot of slopes and he replied that it was mainly gentle gradient. This was not true. The slopes were steep! Coming down was easy but going up was a struggle for quite a few people. There were also steep stairs made of rocks which you need to climb. Certainly not advisable for those with strollers.',\n",
       " ' Piece of history If it s a UNESCO site  it s always worth a visit. Changdeokgung lets you see how the palaces were in the olden times. A very historic place that has been kept fairly well. Not a lot of artifacts but the building structures and surrounding shrubbery make for a very nice walk in the afternoon.',\n",

My friend and I thought that this palace was closed  but because of their celebration of experiencing to meet the palaces  Sorry I forgot the terms   we were able to see a different attraction since South Korea has a lot of palaces. We visited the Secret Garden. If you bought a Combination Ticket  worth 10 000 KRW   there s a different attachment for voucher in going to the Secret Garden. If you want to have the tour of the Secret Garden and you bought the combination ticket  go to the ticketing office first to convert the voucher to a ticket in going to the said tour. We had the 3 30 English tour and it ended at around 5 though what my friend and I was we went ahead of those who had the English tour and savoured the moment of taking pictures of sceneries and ourselves. But I d say it s nice to also listen to the pieces of information that I heard from the tour guide about the Secret Garden since the curiosity of knowing why it is the Secret Garden is explained in the tour.',\n",

There is a secret garden which can be visited only with a tour guide and lasts one and a half hour and costs 5000 won. Find out ahead of time when the visit is available. The information about the garden is worth the visit. The palace is free to those people 65 and older.',\n",

       " ' Superb Secret Garden! While not the biggest palace  this is probably the most visited of the 5 palaces in Seoul. While the biggest palace  Gyeong bok gung  Gung means palace   Chang deok gung was the most preferred palace of the king and his queens  chiefly for one reason  the SECRET GARDEN  which covers  60  of the total palace area. While the palace itself can be entered with a ticket of KRW 3 000 and without a guide  the secret garden has a separate entrance within the palace  and ticket  and can only be accessed with a guide. Each guided tour lasts 90 minutes and tours are run in English and Korean languages  there might be other languages  but am sorry not sure about which ones  maybe Chinese and Japanese as well . The palace itself is open from 9AM to 5PM on all days  Mondays closed . Another important piece of advice  each tour has a cap of 100 joiners and while there are 3 4 English and 4 Korean tours every day  except Mondays  and they sell our pretty fast  apparently 50 passes per tour can also be booked online  though I haven t tried it personally. So unless you are staying for a few days and want to try your luck  try booking the pass in advance. A palace cum garden ticket can be obtained at the main entrance for KRW 8 000. I actually missed the Sunday 3 30 PM  last English tour  and was almost disappointed until I came out and realised that there were 2 Korean tours available for 4 PM and 4 30 PM  ending at 5 30 and 6 PM  even though main gates shut at 5 for new entrants . As it was the last free day I had in Seoul I joined the Korean tour  which was the second best option. Really enjoyed the stunning beauty and grandeur of the secret garden  complete with small ponds with large umbrella esque shelters for the royalty to sit by  waterfalls  and beautiful halls inside  not to mention flower beds and courtyards. And  the Korean guide realised that I had missed the English tour and was kind enough to summarise the brief to me after others had been informed and given time to click pictures. A must do in Seoul  apart from Gyeong bok gung  for the Change of Guard ceremony at 10 AM and 2 PM daily except Tuesdays when it is closed .',\n",

       " ' Korean History Behind Place Worth a visit if you are a history or nature lover. Changedeokgung Palace is one of the UNESCO World Heritage  which was built in 1405 by the king of the Joseon Dynasty. The architectural style is simple and frugal. Behind the palace  there is a Secret Garden which was intended the use of the royal family. It is a beautiful and spacious built landscape. The ticket center staff could not speak English well. Please be prepared it may take longer time than expected to buy the ticket. As I visited during the windy day  part of the Secret Garden was closed. Remember to check before you go.',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung This is a large palace situated on hilly terrain on the northern side of Seoul s downtown area. As a previous reviewer mentioned  you can only go in as part of a tour group and it s easy enough to join. Just buy your ticket and wait for the next group tour in your language  Korean  Chinese  Japanese  English . Changdeokgun is also known as Biwon which is the name given to the Secret Garden behind the palace buildings. The garden is really stunning with ponds  and a library  off limits  situated in the garden. At one point  climbing a steep hill  I felt like I was trekking through a forest. There is also a 750 year old Chinese Juniper tree on the grounds  not to mention other trees that are hundreds of years old. The palace has a sad history    during Japanese rule  it was turned into a zoo. It is beautifully restored now. Of interest are the unpainted servants quarters. ',\n",

       " ' I confuse those two palaces and so does the map The official Seoul tourist map suggests that this palace is above and the other one is close to the metro station. Yet it seems to be a bit different and I got really confused as I thought I was in the other palace. The main gate  from the south west corner off the park  next to the metro station  will get you to this Palace. The other one is more on the east of the park. You can walk from one palace to the other without getting out from the park. Both of the palaces are really nice but lots of open space thus on sunny day make sure you have a hat otherwise you ll end up with a mild sun stroke.',\n",
       " ' One of the most palaces I have seen. This place compares internationally and has a majestic character uniquely its own. I have seen some of the most prominent European palaces and this one is up there with the best. It would be fair to say that every single wooden element is a piece of art in its own right. As far as I was able to tell the entire building is made of wood with no  visible  metallic elements. The wood is meticulously hand painted with stunningly articulate floral patterns. The walls and ceilings are decorated with traditional symbolic paintings. This is a must see and highly recommended. ',\n",

The garden was pretty and it was interesting to see where the royals relaxed  entertained guests and where the prince studied. The garden would be more beautiful during the fall foliage or the spring summer bloom. The tour was 90 min and require quite a bit of walking and some stairs. Would not recommend for those with difficulty walking. The guide was quite knowledgable and shared some good information. ',\n",

The palace is rather small and the highlight would the garden.For this you have to go on the website and make a booking. We chose to go on Christmas Day thinking it would be quiet but our group was large  at least 30  sure reminds of my school trips! . Give yourself half an hour to visit the actual palace itself. I loved the garden as it was huge  sitting in an area much bigger than the palace. It was a hunting ground for the king in the olden days so as to give you an idea how large it was. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of Seoul! However  you can only visit with a guide and therefore cannot enjoy it as much as it should be. I love to sit and watch the world go by so that is not possible. Lovely and well worth a visit. ',\n",
       " ' The Secondary Palace of the Korean Emperor We came here on Tuesday because the Main Palace was closed that day.

We could walk there  but we used the Gyeongbokgung station to Anguk station instead  from here  we walk along Bukchon Hanok Village  then straight to Changdeokgung.  we bought combination tickets for 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine  and I was surprised these include the Secret Garden in this palace  otherwise we need to pay extra 5000 for the tour  I think it is more well preserved than the Gyeongbokgung palace. I love this place more  you can walk along the path of the ancient people of Korea and the Royals used to walk. Personally  it was an amazing experience for me. Some of my friends got tired easy though  I guess it s not for everyone. Lots of picture taking activity.',\n",

I would imagine that it may be less dramatic during a dry season.',\n",

We opted for the additional Secret Garden tour. I am so glad I did  as the gardens were truly beautiful. The gardens can only be viewed by taking part in the guided tour. It was conducted by a quide who s english was clear and easy to understand. She was quite humourous and informative throughout. The only thing I would say is that the tour lasts for 1.5hours and involves some inclines  so comfortable walking shoes are a must. Definitely worth a visit.',\n",

The pomp and pageant including the changing of the guards to the palace entrance is still maintained. The palace and various royal activity houses and the gardens is spread over a vast area which occupies the central Seoul. The plants and various flora were in full bloom and looked stunning.

The area is compact and landscape has a lot of beautiful plants. Best season to go would probably be spring and autumn. Also tried the Secret Garden tour. I takes a bit of physical activity to go through the garden. I was quite a hike. I didn t expect it so we took a longer time touring this place than what we planned.',\n",

The little cafe near the secret garden entrances does some deliciously warming thick rice teas. But the 5 stars especially is because the helpful ticket clerk  instead of just selling me the secret garden and admission for I think 8000W  she checked if I was visiting other palaces  when I said yes  she highly recommended I buy the combined ticket and even asked me to have a good read of the info available before buying. She saved me several thousand Won as the combined ticket was 10 000 Won and I used it to get into 3 palaces  Secret Garden and JongMyo shrine.

But you learn a bit about the history and you ve gotta visit at least one palace while you re in Seoul.

We explored a few areas  and found it a bit underwhelming because it kind of looks similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace. We then went on to the next area  the secret garden  where there was an additional fee of 8000 won to enter. I guess it will be kept a secret because we opted not to enter.

We were lucky that our hanok host helped us prebook the Secret Garden Tour.

Our guide was entertaining and shared many stories about the royalties  as well as the palace architecture. Now I understand why some of the doors are built so low... The pace of the tour was relaxing. There were some steps  upslope  towards the end but nothing difficult. I don t consider myself fit and or athletic  but I had no problems keeping up with the group. My two little kids managed very well too! You may want to visit the loo before the tour. There is only one toilet break during the 90min tour. No outside food and drinks allowed.

Recommended season would be fall.',\n",

It was very interesting to see such an ancient place with so much history. Wheh I was there the tour guide told us that there are usually a lot more people visiting the site but for some reason  the Chinese government put a travel ban on SK. All in all a cool place. Make sure to have some comfy shoes as the walkways are a little rough but apparently for good reason  as your tour guide will explain.',\n",

Korea has an impressive way of preserving their culture and this place really gives you a slice of how ancient Korea was. It was just a bit too cold to explore though during winter as the weather when we were there was at  9 degrees C.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace with a huge garden to explore   wear your walking shoes! Changdeokgung Palace is one of the two largest and most visited palaces in Seoul. They are similar in many ways   well preserved  beautiful  with extensive grounds and many buildings to explore   but Changdeokgung has much larger grounds  which you can tour if you have a special ticket. When you first arrive  you can buy an entrance ticket to the palace  and at the same time can ask for an entry ticket to the  Secret Garden.  This allows you entry at a specified time but doesn t cost anything extra. I ve gone twice and once they just let us in at that time and we were free to wander at will. The second time  there was an English speaking tour guide who showed us a few of the most important sights within the garden. It is amazing how quickly you feel immersed in nature  even though you know you are in the center of a bustling city. It is so quiet and serene   just the thing when city life gets too overwhelming. Definitely wear your walking shoes   the paths are smooth and wide  but the garden is very large and hilly so it requires a bit of stamina to see it all. Young children or anyone with limited mobility will find it tough to see the whole thing.',\n",

We decided to take our place in the queue as in the few minutes we pondered what to do next  the line was growing by the minute. The wait to get tickets was around 30 minutes   which I didn t mind a bit as it was fascinating watching the locals  young and old arrive in their beautiful traditional dress. The Palace offered lots of history and insight into the culture. Constructed in 1405 as a secondary palace of the Joseon Dynasty and rebuilt in 1610 after being destroyed during the Japanese invasion. It then served as the main palace for 270 years. The Koreans in traditional dress added to the intrigue. We paid extra to go into the secret garden and were pleased we had. The autumn colours were beautiful. We didn t do a guided tour due to the next tour not being an English one. We didn t feel we missed out on anything not doing the guided tours  we had a good brochure to guide us around.',\n",

       " ' Yes. this palace is in Seoul City Many thanks to my friend Soon Nam who suggested a visit to the palace as it was in Seoul city. Its easy to get to the Palace either by bus or taxi...for us tourists      .. . I wanted to learn more about Korean people  their history and interaction with other Countries  how Korean culture developed and Korean loyalty and steadfastness. . I visited the Palace in mid November 2017   it was cool with a light breeze .  Inside the grounds it was quiet and tranquil and we walked through my friend explained what the different buildings were   why they building  wing  was built  for whom and when it was built. . We joined an English speaking guide who guided us through and explained why and when the smaller buildings were built and how the buildings were heated during the cold winters. .. MANY THANKS to the guide.. she did an excellent job of explaining in detail.. her English with an eastern American accent was easy to understand .. At a small hill there was a lake and stream that flowed to the lower part and a building where the Imperial family performed annual rituals to honour the planting and harvesting of crops.. .i saw others were dressed in colourful traditional Korean clothing.. later I found out that these were tourists who had rented these. . After about three hours I left the park to return to modern Seoul and found a wonderful place nearby to have lunch on Weekends more people visit the Palace. A delight to be able to have a glimpse of a long time ago Korean palace.',\n",

For example  it does offer a bit more history and authenticity as it is quite a bit older than the other palace which was only recently rebuilt. A major part of the palace are the hidden gardens which were closed when we were there. I can imagine how spectacular those would be on a beautiful day and how much they would add to the experience.',\n",

       " ' A Secret Palace Garden We all know that the winter in Korea is harsh and bitter. The temperature outside was minus 17degrees centigrade. Everything is so cold you could barely hold anything. An intense feeling of numbness permeates my hands while holding my iPhone to take pictures. The freezing cold did not stop us from visiting the Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul Korea. It is a look of a true Korean beauty. It was built in 1405 as a Palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was consisted of so many halls most of which were huge and spacious and were used for the most formal state events  coronation ceremonies and receptions of foreign envoys. A beautiful secret garden Is situated at the back of the Palace which enhanced the unique architectural structure of the pavilions and was intended as a place for relaxation of the King and his royal family. It was also used as a venue for various activities to include sports competition most notably in archery during those days. To better appreciate the history of the Palace there is a guided tour in English for a minimal fee. There is also a small fee for admission to the secret garden and the main Palace itself.',\n",

       " ' A must see for any visit to Seoul Wonderfully beautiful in history  tradition and architecture. Many locals opt to rent traditional outfits and come to the Palace to pay their respects. Selfies galore and of course people taking photos of groups and so on. I especially loved the idea that during the week there were many school field trips so the grounds were abundant with young people....and young people love to practice their English on you. Had a ball meeting and conversing with so many locals.',\n",

I also visited the larger Gyengbokgung Palace  which although impressive I feel could not compete with the beautiful secret garden at Changdeokgung. I would definitely recommend doing the secret garden tour  our guide was wonderful and very informative. ',\n",
       " ' Secret garden not a garden Went to see the secret garden. In winter  at least  there is no garden to see in the sense of plants or landscapes. Rather this is a tour of the private palace buildings that you can t otherwise access. Quite interesting and a good guide  but don t expect beautiful plush interiors that you d see in British or European palaces   these are external views with a few empty rooms. OK but not a must do.

It was during Hanbok Festival when we visited so there were long lines of people waiting to get their handbok in the shops outside the palace. My friend and I didn t want to waste our time lining up so we just went in. The palace s entrance fee is cheap but if you go wearing hanbok the entrance fee would be free.  D',\n",

We were here during the Lunar New Year so there were many people in traditional dress taking pictures and it made you feel like you had gone back in time.

Simply marvelous seeing the architecture. Can get a little crowded and plenty of tourists standing by and sitting on perfect photo ops which can get annoying. But if you have the time its definitely worth it to visit this palace!',\n",
       " ' Ok to visit We kept our visit of Changdeokgung Palace rather short since there is not much to see. The buildings are scattered in a rather large area. There are no detailed explanations about the life in the palace and the purpose of the different buildings. The gardens are pretty unkempt. Been there done that. If you re nearby have a look.',\n",

The rebuild is interesting enough  but you cannot enter any of the buildings at all and those that have their doors open  and that s not very many  have little to see inside. It s also very busy with noisy tour groups and school children. Regardless  it s not to be missed. Buy the Royal Palace Pass for W10 000 as it s a BIG saving on the six sites it includes. The Secret Garden is a separate tour  but is actually more interesting than the palace  but you can only visit the garden if you visit the palace too. The Pass package includes both.',\n",

The palace has many entries and it was in in city which was good. The structural of the buildings were in good condition and very details  even there were lots of small allies that unable to enter but did not cut the fun to take selfies and pictures. The secret garden was so exclusive but need abit of walking up and down  after all not too bad because the tour guide was in slow pace allowing guests to walk slowly to see  look around and experience. The structural of those buildings were in good form and able to know how the King relaxed  the views of those big lotus ponds  trees  water and breezes..which was good experience.',\n",

The Secret Garden may only be accessed  however  by joining a group tour organized by palace management. Better check on the tour schedules. I didn t bother and got stuck with the Korean tour group. I have zero Korean language background aside from the usual hi  bye  and thanks. So  I couldn t really appreciate any information from the tour as it wasn t in English. Aside from the Secret Gardens  what makes this palace unique is the collection of reconstructed imperial government offices in the grounds. It is a maze in that area. Picture perfect opportunities also if you have your traditional Korean costume on. Now  if only it wasn t raining heavily when I was there... ',\n",

       " ' UNESCO World Heritage Site   Changdeokgung Palace is awe inspiring! We had a beautiful morning for our visit to Changdeokgung Palace  all the better to take it in at an unhurried pace. Changdeokgung was originally built as a secondary to the main  Gyeongbokgung Palace  which I have toured on several previous occasions. The main difference about Changdeokgung Palace is that it was built with the full intention of integrating it into its natural surroundings. So while the buildings may appear strange  they are intended to harmonize with the topography according to  pungsu principles . The palace structures are all situated to the south  with the immense  Secret Garden  at the rear and to the north. Although the original buildings of Changdeokgung were destroyed by fire  the reconstruction are said to retain a high degree of authenticity. Anyway you look at it  it s immense and gorgeous! You do have to hit the timing right to visit the Secret Garden  w  purchase of a separate ticket   as tour groups go at different times  in different languages. A charming new tradition we noticed is that many shops nearby the palace offer Hanbok  traditional dress  rental. Many groups of beautiful  young  mostly Japanese  it seemed  women were everywhere in Hanbok and pretty  flower laced  hair do s  happily taking selfies. We thought them all quite adorable and a nice addition to the feeling of stepping back into a page in history!',\n",
       " ' A Highlight of Seoul An UNESCO World Heritage Site  built during the Joseon Dynasty in 1405  Changdeokgung Palace is both a highlight of Seoul and a must on any history lovers itinerary. The gardens are beautiful with mature  think 300 year old  trees. The palace itself is historical and a good look at Korean architecture from that era. I love how the palace compounds blends so well with the surrounding nature. Recommended.',\n",

I actually went back three times on the same day for it because I kept missing the time or the available tickets. They kept telling me I m late even though I was 30 minutes early. Only thing I muttered was  But I ran all the way here from the station.  Luckily  I got to be part of the 3pm Huwon tour and it was well worth it. Changdeokgung is interconnected with another palace known as Changgyeonggung. It is located just beside the entrance for the secret garden tour. It s a small palace unlike the other ones but worth a visit if you re into history. ',\n",
       " ' Worth getting the free tour We just so happened to catch the free English tour of the palace and were glad we did. Our tour guide was fantastic and it was a pleasure to learn about the history. We then followed this with a tour of the secret garden. The garden was very nice to see  but not particularly spectacular. You have to have a guided tour and there were a lot of people when we were there which made it a bit tricky to hear  plus we had to keep stopping to wait for everyone to catch up   take photos etc which made it quite a long tour. Overall it was worth it though.',\n",

If you have time there is the Changgyeonggung Palace adjacent and reached by an inter connecting gate.',\n",

       " ' Historical site   but are my dogs tired Very interesting site  much of it purposefully left unrestored. Large site  the tour guide stated the grounds covered 110 acres. Make sure you have comfy shoes and are prepared for a lot of walking. If you take to Secret Garden tour  be prepared for some fairly steep grades. It s definitely not for mobility challenged individuals. One of the members on the tour dragged around luggage for the entire tour. If you take luggage to the tour  do yourself and others the courtesy of storing your bags in a locker at a subway or rail station before you go here.',\n",

       " ' Secret Garden is the highlight! As far as palace goes  I very much prefer the much grander Gyeongbokgung Palace. But this palace has something that draws you in the moment you step in the secret garden  you have to take a tour for this . My guide is amazing and you can almost imagine the royalties walking the path towards the secret garden for some R and R. The fall colours make the place even more magical than the name suggests  making you wish you have a secret garden of your own too.',\n",

Otherwise you will have to test ur luck! I waited 30 minutes in line and lucky to buy last tickets for 15 30 in the morning    but it totally worth my waiting I was touched by my city. So much history in it and such a beautiful garden. It is different style from China and Japan. Focus on nature itself no artificial no frills very natural! It calms my mind! ',\n",
       " ' Live the Experience I would definitely recommend you dress the part when visiting the palaces around Seoul. It s a great place to check out the history of Korea and immerse yourself in the Korean culture. It s so much fun to dress up with your friends and take pictures. If your going to rent a hanbok  traditional Korean attire  I would plan to do it for more than two hours so you re not restricted especially if you like exploring and taking pictures.',\n",
       " ' For the Secret Garden Our destination for today is Changdeokgung Palace. It is better to drop off at Anguk Station Subway Exit 3  because it is just 5 minutes walk away from the Palace. English guided tour starts at 10 30am. Also visit Secret Garden when you have time. ',\n",

       " ' Palace and Secret Garden Tour It was a very nice tourist place to visit. They have a secret garden tour that costs extra if you don t buy the combination ticket. It s a guided tour that takes about an hour ands half. It s quite a bit of walking so make sure you re up for it. Overall  the palace was nice and the grounds were very scenic. For me most of the palaces in Seoul are very similar to each other and that includes this one too. ',\n",
       " ' Part of Korean history This was a backup residence for Korean Royal family. It s well maintained. The change of guests show is interesting. I think that s about all.',\n",
       " ' Nice place to visit Most reviews I read recommended the secret garden tour and I would agree. You have to get a reservation in advance. They only have 100 spots for each tour and 50 are available for online reservation 6 days ahead at 10am. I went on the site and signed up at exactly 10am. Once I finished I looked back at the site and there were 0 remaining spots so they go quick! Once you arrive you have to show the reservation and actually buy the ticket. If you plan to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace as well  but the Integrated ticket instead and save 1000 or more. The tour is normally 90min long but they are doing a trial and allowing you to just walk on your own. Had I known this I wouldnt have bothered with the english tour and picked a better time. At my own pace I finished in about an hour.',\n",

We bought the combined ticket at 10000 won which includes entry to all 5 palaces and the secret garden tour. We walked around part of the palace on our own. The palace looked very simple but the gardens were beautiful. There are some steep walks around the secret garden so wear comfortable shoes. The guide stopped for a few minutes at each stop to allow us to rest or take photos. ',\n",
       " ' Palace and Secret Gardens all in one area The palace as with others in Korea does not have a lot of furniture or artefacts on display  however the palace its self and all the associated building as very interesting from an architectural viewpoint. Lots of people walking around wearing Hanbok which adds to the atmosphere. As other people have stated the secret gardens are not to be missed  very well laid out and when we were there last week the trees were in all their Autumn glory with vivid colours on display.  Not suitable for those with limited mobility . It s a huge complex if you decide to see everything on site including the secret garden and easily takes around two to three hours to enjoy it all. Would certainly recommend.',\n",

       " ' Great palace and evening visit took it up a notch!! Visited in the afternoon and was really enamoured by the splendid pagodas and vast expanse of history right in the midst of the modern city . To top it all that day it was open in the evening also with a concert which really made it a memorable experience!! Definitely worth a visit and do not miss an evening opening if available. ',\n",
       " ' Fabulous architecture Beautifully painted buildings  dancheong is the term for the painting  arranged in serene sight lines. Not too miss is the secret garden  a separate ticket is needed. The guided english tour was ok but seemed to be about the same information available on the placards. The gardens layout respects the contours of the hills  with man made intrusions carefully inserted into nature. ',\n",

Korean history is depicted and those have an inclination towards history may love it. Place is crowded with both foreign and local sight seers tourists',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Palace. This is the smaller of the two principal palaces in Seoul  and unlike its larger twin  this one was restored after being attacked and damaged by the Japanese centuries ago. The temples and courtyards are divided into three distinct areas  all of which had to be traversed before an audience with the King could be granted. The Queen s chambers were separate from the King s  but when trying for children  there was a separate area without any furnishings  for fear of an assassination attempt!',\n",
       " ' Jongno is a gem This palace is located as well in Jongno adjacent to Gyeongbokgung   only a few minutes walk away. I love this palace because I feel like it s massive than Gyeongbokgung and is less crowded. It s possibly because there is no ceremony happening unlike the aforementioned.',\n",
       " ' Lived in Korea for one year.. still one of the best place on earth I totally fell in love with all of those Korean Palaces. Indeed  when you have a walk there  it is so relaxing  so calm.

Only this building has the original blue roof tile    which was made on 17th century.',\n",

The palaces are very well preserved and the gardens are just beautiful. Every day at 3 00 and 4 30 pm there is a tour of the Secret Garden which you cannot enter on your own. We did the tour and you get to see a big area of the complex otherwise not accessible to visitors. It s free of charge if you buy the booklet with access to this palace and Gyeongbokgung. ',\n",

There was only a small cafe refreshments area  especially relevant for us as it was a bright hot day. There are so many photo opportunities  any amateur photographer will be more than satisfied.',\n",

       " ' Stunning This is my college roommate s favorite palace  so this is the sole palace I visited. I especially loved watching the girls  mostly  in traditional hanbok taking selfies and photo shoots. I was able to witness the changing of the guard  and partook in the tea and traditional sweets in the Sujong room. Admittedly the tea and sweets were approximately  25  and I didn t get my money s worth  but it s for the experience and I have no regrets. The grounds were gorgeous and went on and on. There were musicians playing in the background and I couldn t resist take part of getting my photo taken in a hanbok on a regal throne as it was free for tourists.',\n",

       " ' Amazing place We went June 2018. Got the tickets for the secret garden tour the same day. Highly recommend the secret garden tour. It s the prettiest area. The landscaping is very pretty. Took us about 4 hours to tour the palace. Much longer than I anticipated. Many tourists dressed in hanbok. Wear comfortable shoes because the palace is huge and lots of walking. Pack a water bottle because it s hot.',\n",

       " ' Smaller palace near to Namsan park Came here to have a look at the palace and especially  the guard changing ceremony. Located quite near City Hall metro station. Guard changing at 11am and lasted just a short while before the whole ceremony repeats again. There is a small booth for a quick free hanbok rental that allows you 3 mins to put on for photoshoot. The palace itself is not that big. If you just want to see the guard changing ceremony  just come to the outside of the palace as you do not need entrance ticket for it. Interesting to see the guard changing ceremony though.',\n",
       " ' Amazing palace It s such a beautiful palace with an extraordinary design. You need to walk around in any corner you can  it worth it. Prepare your camera to take some photos  wear sneakers and an umbrella if it is raining.',\n",
       " ' Visiting with friends We walk here from City Hall where we were staying. The main entrance is now opened as I remember that it was under reconstruction then. There were guards doing sentry duties and they attracted much photo session. I was delighted to be granted free access being a  Senior Citizen . It s the usual visual to see how royalty live in the past. Lots of ground to cover as the site is huge. Highlight for me is to see a lot of folks wearing traditional Korean costume. And many were foreigners renting and wearing them. I said hello to a group of students from Indonesia dressed in the hanboks. I greet them in Bahasa which surprised them. ',\n",
       " ' Book the Secret Garden tour! The palace is nice but in my opinion the Secret Garden is the highlight. Unfortunately you can only visit it as part of tour but it s worth it.',\n",
       " ' Immense and beautiful. I didn t even see the entire palace  because it is enormous. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to do a lot of walking. The architecture is simply a wow  and the restoration work keeps the vibrancy alive. Two things that stood out  the portrait gallery with it s haunting lack of portraits  one can only imagine!   and the wonderful trees they have gone to some pains to keep. The trees alone were worth going to see.  Yeah  I m weird that way.  ',\n",

       " ' Great historical land mark We went to see this palace built during Joseon dynasty and the palace was a reminder of great design work at that time. You need to go to Anguk station exit 3 and walk about 450 to 500 m  please follow the sign to find this palace',\n",
       " ' OK Wanted to visit gyeongbokgung but it was closed on a tuesday  so we settled for this instead. Free admission if you wear Hanbok. Not as pretty as Gyeongbokgung in my opinion and after awhile every part looks the same. Nevertheless  we still took some pretty photos in our hanbok.',\n",
       " ' Stunning well preserved example Beautiful  very interesting and so well preserved! I spent several hours here  despite the severe June heat and humidity and was absolutely fascinated by the history of the palace   highly recomended',\n",
       " ' Tiring! We went for the 10 30am Secret Garden tour on a hot June day. We find the tour a bit slow for our pace. The garden itself was alright. However  we find that the morning noon sun was quite draining. And there were some uphill and downhill that we need to climb. It might be difficult  if not impossible for people who have mobility problems. The garden itself and the scenery was very nice  but after touring the garden for 1.5 hours  we were not so keen to look at the palace anymore  as we have seen the bigger one the day before . Overall  I would recommend this for those who likes to look at architecture and learn about history. But probably it won t be very interesting for young kids.',\n",
       " ' Interesting but lacking I went later in the day so I missed the last Secret Garden tour gog foreigners  it turns out you re not allowed on your own and in my opinion without the secret garden it s good but not great. The gift shop had some great items at very low cost!',\n",
       " ' A pleasant escape inside the metropolis Changdeokgung is conveniently located close to downtown Seoul  just a short walk from Insadong. If you re only going to visit one palace in Seoul  I suggest Gyeongbokgung since there s more to see but Changdeokgung is also a very nice place to escape the hurried athmosphere of the city. If you re planning to visit the secret garden  make sure to reserve in advance and check the timetable for tours. Admission to the palace is separate and only costs somewhere around 1000 won per person.',\n",
       " ' Nice walk and relax It s nice place clean and so peaceful and beautiful garden to walk can be romantic as well many young people s hangout in weekend and wear Korea customized outfits they look so beautiful too been here many times but still love it ',\n",
       " ' Worth booking the secret garden tour It is worth booking ahead to do the secret garden palace tour. As has been mentioned in other reviews  it s a relatively hilly landscape so I noticed that older attendees didn t complete all of the walk. The palace is large and pretty and the gardens lovely  it was just approaching cherry blossom season when I visited . It was nice to get some context the tour itself lasted around 90 minutes and the guide was very good. The tour comprised a very large group but given the vastness of the gardens  the crowd did not overwhelm. Afterwards  enjoy a cup of local tea at one of the cafes and take in the surroundings. Lots of people visit fully clad in traditional outfits  so it is worth taking a moment to people watch and appreciate the traditional vibes.  I believe there is a discount for entry   it is free if people dress up! ',\n",
       " ' Not much to see My mother and I did a secret garden tool of the palace. It was not that great. The tour was in Chinese since my mother only speaks chinese. It was a free tour offered by the park. The group was about 30 people with some family with young children and seniors. The tourist guide was not good at all. Her Chinese was not clear  so most of the time we could not understand her. The garden itself is also not what we expected. It s not a botanic garden with flowers and plants  rather it s a big wooded area with natural trees on hills up and down. There were few residence halls here and there. So really not much to see. The guide walked very fast and never bother to check on anybody. It was like a hiking trip with climbing up and downs. The last draw was that the guide lead the group to an almost vertical up stairs in the bushes and just went up without asking anybody if they could do it. I would not risk my mother breakkng her leg gojng up there. So  with some other families with young children we had to look around to find another way out. It was totally unprofessional! We went to see other parts of the palace and didn t find the impressive. All the big halls have tall stairs to climb  so not easy for elderly. I don t recommend the secret garden tool. Especially if you are not fit for hiking.',\n",
       " ' The secrete garden tour was interesting!! We went to see the secret garden English tour which took about 90 minuets. There were about 50 people together. A guide was explaining about each spots in the garden and it was very interesting!! It was such a bloody hot day so it s better to bring some water with you if you visit in summer!! The garden paths are up and down  so it s better to wear comfortable shoes!! spots shoes are better ',\n",
       " ' Unworthy Tour of the Secret Garden Entrance to the Changdeokgung Palace costed 3000 wons  but the Secret Garden could only be admitted by joining a 5 000 won tour at the entrance. Tourists are only allowed to tour the garden with the Guide. We visited in July and joined a Chinese tour at 12 30pm. The Garden is not big and with just a few buildings attractions inside  many of which did not allow entry. The tour can be completed within 30 minutes. However  the guide prolonged the tour to more than one hour. It was very hot on a summer day with lots of mosiquitos  and no fun to stand in front of a lily pond for 20 minutes listening to the guide chatting with tourists on topics unrelated to the palace or the garden. In fact  relevant historical information provided was minimal. The tour ended up being a boring torture and I would advise skipping it.',\n",
       " ' My favorite of the palaces in Seoul The style of Korean Palace architecture and beautifully painted exteriors really appears to me and this one was my favorite of those I visited. I especially liked the  secret garden  acessed by paying an additional fee and waiting to the appointed time to be led through by a guide. Despite the crowd herded through this way the extensive gardens  pavilions  lakes and so on were beautiful and worth the extra time and expense. It is very hilly with lots of steps so you may want to think twice is you have physical limitations. ',\n",
       " ' Korean Heritage Well restored palace structures and a real sense of history palpable throughout the grounds of the site. Wife and daughter rented Hanboks nearby and toured the area while being photographed. Highly recommended destination for all travelers while in country.',\n",
       " ' Traditional Korean architecture   nice for a morning walk Not to big  but a nice park for a morning walk to see traditional Korean architecture and to learn some history. Less crowded than the Gyeongbokgung Palace and it is great with combination to visit the Bukchon area. If you rent a Hanbok  you get the entrance for free. Be prepared to meet a lot of girls in traditional clothes  especially in the weekends You have to pay extra to visit the Secret garden.',\n",
       " ' The best of the palaces So I visited all the palaces and shrines that are included in the pass you can buy for a slight discount  you can get it at any of them at the entrance gate . if you are limited on time this is the best one to visit. There is another palace right next to it but it is a separate entrance fee so you can easily hit up two of them. The additional charge for the secret garden is worth it  especially if you go in the summer to get some shade! It is located in an area that has lots of other sites as well.',\n",

But I had nothing to do in the morning when most of the shops are not opened at 9am. The entrance fee is just a few bucks so when u visit this palace with high expectations  u lose nothing but just time. Just go in and have a feel of the korean palaces. At least when u visit one  u feel the connection when you watch korean dramas.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden needs a guide The Palace itself is nice  though similar to others. The entrance fee is cheap. If you want to visit the secret garden you should know that it is a guided tour that will take 1 2 hours  but I am not sure when the tours start. I do know there is one at 2 30pm. But other than that I am not sure  perhaps they are every half hour or hour  I don t know  we did not have enough time as we were headed back to our hotel to catch the bus to the airport  so we didn t get to visit. There is also another palace you need to pay for inside  also not expensive  it needs about an hour  I think we went inside there  walked to the other entrance and then walked to get something to eat. It is a nice walk through the area The rest of the palace is interesting  if you have some extra time and not sure where to go  I think it is worth seeing.',\n",
       " ' the most liveable looking Seoul palaces In contrast with the more formal Gyeongbokgung  Changdeokgung looks like a pleasant place to live  especially with its extensive attached secret garden. The casual visitor may only see a collection of buildings  but each closer look reveals new touches  as if peeling an onion... Walking through the grounds  one will at times catch a particularly harmonious fleeting glimpse  be it an alignment of roofs  a mountain through a small gate  a wall accommodating a tree  etc. The large number of healthy looking birds further confirms that this is one of the nicest green spots in Seoul    Attached is a picture of the schedule of the various guided tours in their respective languages. My English speaking guide spoke unaccented colloquial US English. Be warned that the secret garden tour is arduous for elderly people  as the footpath includes some uneven stone stairs  and the tour is almost 2 hours in length  with few opportunities to sit.',\n",

However  it s a good mock up to know the history of Korea. A small palace  not really too much to see. King s life looks boring. ',\n",

No regret if you cannot enter the Secret Garden due to full booking in summer. Landscape and scenery are nothing special there. It was very humid in July when I went there. But I believe its scenery would be very beautiful when maples blossom in fall. In general  the buildings of Changdeokgung Palace outside Secret Garden are much better than those in Gyeongbokgung Palace.',\n",

Are the ancient Koreans sitting around in an empty room all the time? I m not sure  but the experience could of been greatly enhanced if the buildings actually have things in it for people to get a glimpse of life of ancient Korean royalty. Finally  the main palace within this palace the front door that you can see the emperor s throne was blocked off for  Korean language tour only . So if you re a foreigner you re NOT allowed to get the best view to see inside the palace. The only reason this is a 4 star and not a 5 star.',\n",

The gardens were especially nice and the guide who led the tour was exceptionally good. Be prepared to walk  about 2 3 mi  on hilly terrain if you tour the garden. The only downside of the tour was the relentless rain  which was quite heavy at times. If you visit the site at the beginning of the rainy season  bring rain gear.',\n",

The palace has an impressive gate way which is welcoming and peaceful  also provides an insight into Korean architecture. It is an expansive compound with several structures  Kings council hall  residence  Queens residence  government offices  ornate ceilings  secret garden etc. So there is a lot of walking but not much climbing.

The garden is only accessed via guided tours  which is understandable in a way  since you don t want visitors picking flowers or dabbling their feet in the pools  but it does take away some of the charm of this garden. However  even with that caveat  it is still worth visiting as a place of peace  beautiful scenes and great photo opportunities. Be prepared to walk a long way   in summer hats and water bottles are a must.',\n",

Although lacking the grandeur of Gyeongbokgung  Changdeokgung boasts of being the most recent palace to actually have been used and of having a huge garden  forest  actually  right behind it. If you only have one palace to visit  I d recommend Gyeongbokgung    unless it s in the fall. They say the Secret Garden is the most beautiful during that time. TIP  Those who wear hanbok can enter the palace free. You can also avail of the Royal Palace Pass for 10 000 won that gives you free entrance to 5 palaces  including the Secret Garden .',\n",

       " ' Mixed feeling I went at 10 am and there were not a lot of people. The palace buildings are nice and there are some beautiful details. Some of the trees were blossoming which gave it a more picturesque aura. When we tried to go to the Secret Garden we realised we can only visit with a tour. So be aware that you may have to wait for the next tour to get in. The tour took 1h30m. If you are into tours than by all means wait and go. I did and sincerely regretted it. The tour doesn t give you a lot of useful information and you also are not allowed to walk freely and admire what you want to look at. I left the palace with mixed feelings.',\n",

The architecture and placement of flora and fauna makes it a wonderful place to get pictures and envisioned what it was like living then by the the royals. The Huwon Tour took 1.5 hrs on top of the 1 2 hrs you need at the palace and go on weekdays when it s less crowded to ensure you can get tickets for the tour. ',\n",

They sell separately for secret garden ticket and palace entrance ticket. for me its pretty good deal. I dont have to queue for bought entrance ticket for each palace I want to. Changdeokgung is massive palace  but maybe not as big as Gyeongbokgung. But in this palace there is a secret garden that can only be enter in certain time. and must be guided. it even got secured by 2 security personel. I got here only 2 hours before closed. So I didn t get much around the palace itself. We straight to secret garden entrace  and thank god the guide wasn t there yet. after the guide arrived we enter the secret garden. don t worry the guide was speaking english  also there is a chinese tour for certain time. the guide told us that Secret Garden can only be enter by the king himself  other people can enter this side of the palace only by king permission. so its truly a privileges for us to enter this secret garden. the garden is very much preservative and I can see why you can only enter in certain time and with personal guide. Its like went inside another world  its not like seoul.. when you enter you can only feel peace. the air is different  even though the city just right upon you. I just want to stay there as long as I could. But I could not because the guide only give us 10 15 minutes spare time for each site we visit. wear a nice and comfy shoes because the walk can take for 1 1 5 hours. and there quite few hills. my friend just went under surgeries last month and can t take the hills very well. security guard was nice and keeping her a company when we continue our tour. for me if you visit seoul and have extra time. do visit this palace and secret garden for certain.',\n",
       " ' a must see this is a must when visiting Seoul. there are several options  single ticket for the palace or palace and secret gardens. The secret gardens can only be visited by guided tour and these seem to be very popular and sell out quickly. There is another entrance to a palace for an additional fee too close to the secret garden entrance. People can access the palace grounds for free if they get dressed up in traditional clothes',\n",

You can not enter without buying the tour tickets. But I read that they have fifty tickets on sale on that day as well so we went before opening to queue and managed to get tickets. I would advise getting the integrated palace pass as it is more worthwhile for visiting all the palaces and Jongmyo. As long as you take the guided tour it wouldn t seem like a blur of palaces. Each one had its unique features and place in history. In spring the flowers are lovely and the architecture layout here I feel is the best of the palaces. It is a lot of walking for old folks to do and a bit of uphill and downhill especially at the last leg of the Huwon tour  so wear good walking shoes. The guide does give breaks at each point though and there is a toilet inside. The cafe and souvenir shop in the palace grounds is really nice do check it out. No food served though.',\n",

Reasons  1. mostly not as crowded 2. Wonderful garden  especially in autumn and spring   In summer more shade then Gyeongbokgung! 3. A bit closer to the part of the city with traditional houses and many neat coffee shops. 4. Closer to Insadong 5. Closer to Jongmyo Shrine 6. Neighbouring Changgyeong palace is worth a visit  too. In summer there are night tours through the beautifully lit up premises. You need to reserve tickets beforehand! What you should do at Gyeongbokgung however is to watch the change of the guards. However you would not need to pay any entrance fee to do so. Enjoy your stay!',\n",

There are very few building that are open  and most that are aren t terribly ornate. You walk around and look at the exterior of the building with the doors all closed and all the mini complexes have the same architecture. It becomes rather repetitive. I don t feel like you need to spend too much exploring every corner of the palace  hit the highlights and move on.

Changdeokgung is without a doubt the better of the two. Most friends and family who come to Korea also agree. It s not symmetric  but it s a lot more peaceful  and there are many hidden spots without people  even on crowded days.

       " ' Two Palaces in one. I m not sure which is which  but this pair of palaces and the Secret Garden almost compare in scope to the Forbidden City in Beijing. What they lack in size and grandeur  they make up for in aesthetics. The palace is lovely and verdant. Buy the Royal Pass for a few extra 1000 Won  a few    and see the Secret Garden  both palaces  the temple across the street  also a UNESCO heritage site  and spend the day walking the pathways of Korean kings and queens of old.',\n",
       " ' Visit the Secret Garden! The real highlight is the secret garden. Do not miss it. So pretty and so worth the tour. In my opinion  far more worth a visit compared to Gyeongbokgung.',\n",
       " ' One of the must do s in Seoul Two weeks ago we visited this Palace and Secret Garden on a guided tour. It was a highlight of our holiday. The tour guide gave us a glimpse of what life would have been like and was well prepared with answers to any questions. The secret garden does involve a hill climb that is short but not suitable for anyone on crutches or in a wheelchair or with breathing difficulties  however if the guide is informed they will take an alternative route. A very peaceful and historic place to visit. Toilets are spread around and places to buy drinks. Very clean.',\n",
       " ' UNESCO heritage You must come to this place if you re in Seoul. this UNESCO heritage offer a beautiful place. behind this palace you can see the beautiful secret garden. by adding 6000won you can go inside and get a tour. and don t forget also visit the Korean traditional village near this palace about 15min on walk to Bukchon hanok village.',\n",
       " ' Historical place! Amazing! This place is amazing. The main entrance fee is  3 000W. It is worth it 100 . There is some temples that were under reconstruction but still a good place to visit. It is very easy to get here via subway or bus. Make sure you go early because the later you go the busier it gets. ',\n",
       " ' Nice place to check out Korean heritage A beautiful preserved palace. Authentic and bring you back to the past. We waited for the free English tour. Please check the website for timings. The guided tour helps in understanding more about the palace areas. Easy to manoeuvre around with children. If you want to visit the secret palace  it s better to reserve a place online first on the website. The secret garden is worth a visit and a very peaceful place. However  there are many steps at certain parts so it may be difficult to move with the elderly and kids in strollers. ',\n",
       " ' Look around Nice if you have the time  if not I would opt for Gyeongbokgung palace and the Bukchon Hanok Village  around sunset it s even nice . As many of the touristic sites many tourists and locals are wearing traditional Korean clothing so you can get some nice  and sometimes funny  pictures.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful place! Beautiful architecture! Especially the roofs and how every building s roof layer with each other. If you like ancient oriental architecture this is a must visit. You will also see many people walking around in Hanbok. I believe it is because entering in Hanbok is free and it s a great place to take photos in Hanbok too. There is also a separate area called the Secret Garden which one can only enter by joining a guided tour that comes in different languages. I chose the English tour and learnt a lot about the palace s history.',\n",
       " ' Similar palace This Palace is very similar to the Gyeonbokgung Palace  but much smaller. If you are short on time I would go to the Gyeonbokgung Palace. An hour would be enough to see the entire place.',\n",
       " ' Peaceful palace this is probably the second famous palace tourist will visit. entrance fee is USD2.60 for adult and free for children below 6. the secret garden is only allowed with guided tour  make sure you book ur tour at least 1month in advance. cuz it normally sold out on the day itself. Otherwise  just freely rom around the garden is very relax too. suggest to visit in spring.. there are 2 big peach blossom tree which is very nice for photo taking',\n",
       " ' Must see A great experience as part of the Korean culture. It s interesting to get the guided tour in order to understand what each building was for. Also a tour of the secret garden is recommended. Very beautiful but even more so with spring and specially in fall. ',\n",
       " ' Not So Big Palace This palace not as big as Gyeongbokgung palace but its connected to Changgyeonggung palace. If you want to go to Secret Garden better use Hanbok  Traditional Korea T Shirt  because its free',\n",

       " ' Interesting and similar to Gyeongbokgung palace Not to miss if you are in Seoul historical area. Similar to Gyeongbokgung palace for most of the people. Maybe experts will notice some differences. Nevertheless interesting walk through the various buildings  however not allowed to go inside  and the park. During spring time the trees are starting to bloom and everything becomes beautiful. For people not speaking korean language  there are free guided tours provided in other languages  english  chinese  japanese ..  The entry fee of 3000W  approx. 3   is very reasonable. You may add 5000W  5   for the secret garden which is part of the park but only accessible at certain times and number of visitors is limited to 100 per tour in order to preserve the area.',\n",
       " ' Filled a few hours The palace complex is similar to many others. If you have been to a few palaces it s more of the same. If it s your first one then it s great as it id not too large. Palace took over an hour to explore. Worth popping in to the Secret Garden at the back...An additional 5000 won for the 90min tour. Very pretty garden and a nice change from the palace buildings. Interesting contrast seeing city buildings all around the palace. Easily accessible from Anguk station on the orange line. Take exit 3 and walk straight ahead. 5 mins max. Bukchon area is very close by too with traditional homes  restaurants and shopping. ',\n",
       " ' A must go for history buffs and nature lovers This is one of the Unesco heritage sites one should visit when in Seoul. It is the palace where the last remaining members of the Korean monarchy lived until the 1980s. So you will be able to see how they lived here during the 1900s to 1980s and witness the traces of modern contraptions during that era. Although the infrastructure of most of the buildings within the palace are not original as the original palace was destroyed during a fire  the new structures  still pretty old since it was rebuild in the 1700s to 1800s  are magnificent. I absolutely love the colours and design of the rooftops of the buildings within this palace. There is also the secret garden which is really beautiful and perfect for Instagram and offers you an insight of the life of the Korean monarchy. recommended to join the free tours that is provided  subjected to different timings for Korean  Chinese  Japanese and English . Separate secret garden tours are charged at extra fees. If you intend to visit more than 3 royal palaces in Seoul  would recommend to get the Royal Palace Pass to enjoy more discount on the entrance fees to all of the palaces in Seoul.',\n",

       " ' Simple but elegant palace The place reminds me of the forbidden palace in Beijing. However  the place is much simpler and smaller. I d still say it s a place you must visit on your first trip to Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Great palace We went there to explore the unesco heritage and we were pleased to be able to understand better the Korean history and culture. The palace is really nice and well maintained and you can visit it with a free guided tour booked on seoul information centre website If you have time for only one palace maybe not this one thought ',\n",
       " ' Dull palace There are other attractions inside this palace but you have to pay for them e.g. the secret garden. Maybe this is more beautiful during spring bloom or summer. Not so interesting during winter. Bring a stroller if you have young children. ',\n",
       " ' April is the time to Visit! It s another palace that is located in Seoul city center. Lots of Cherry trees and this facts makes the best time to visit stout April when the cheery blossom is at its peak.',\n",
       " ' A taste of Royal Korea We enjoyed our 2 hour visit on a sunny morning in late March. The first cherry trees were in blossom beside some of the palace buildings  and everyone was taking photos beside them. There were lots of visitors but the place is so big you can easily get away from the crowds. We enjoyed seeing locals in Korean dress  it helped us imagine what the palace looked like when in use. After lunch we walked around Bukchon village and had a great day.',\n",

The last English tour starts at 15 30. 5  Good cafe  no food  only drinks  and a shop.',\n",
       " ' Check the guided tour timetable before going During winter time the beauty of this place is impaired  so if you have to choose go to Gyeongbokgung Palace instead. However  in Autumn and Spring time  I believe this might be a must seeing sight. Before going  check on the website the guided tour timetable  since you can only visit the Secret Garden if you join one. It works the same way for the Jongmyo Shrine  but if I m not wrong you can visit it without guide on Saturdays.',\n",
       " ' Not pretty in March I went in March and in the fall. I preferred it much more in the fall with the colorful leaves. This time around  it was deserted and quite sad looking. I also went to the Secret Garden and did not enjoy it during March. Go there in the spring  summer or fall. Don t waste your time and money in the pre spring season.',\n",
       " ' Near Blue House and great souvenirs you can t find anywhere else! This palace is across the street from the Great King SeJong. It s a long walk so take some walking shoes. There is a National Palace Museum of Korea inside on the left. We found some pretty cool souvenirs you can t find anywhere else in Seoul! You can peek over the wall  and there is the Blue House. If you book in advance  you can visit the Blue House too. We got cancelled because of the demonstration happening during our visit.',\n",
       " ' Quite a grand place to visit The palace is rather grand to walk around  with many halls scattered around the large compound. Initially it was quite interesting  but after a while  the subsequent halls look quite the same. Still a great visit to explore the history of South Korea. ',\n",
       " ' Another wonderful palace The palace is located around the city and easy to go to there and rich the area. The palace is also wonderful',\n",

       " ' Nice Palace The palace was nice and was interesting. Not sure if they do it everyday  but while we were there  a lot of people dressed in historic local attire  both male and female  were there and it was very neat. Very friendly people and willing to take pictures with the tourists without having to pay. When they close  they close and they have several people rounding up slow moving people pushing them toward the door..so don t plan to get there late and overstay.',\n",
       " ' Very cool Saw changing of the guards Buildings are very interesting and seem to be in the middle of Seoul If you can go with a guide or someone knowledgeable it makes the visit far more informative Prepare to spend a couple of hours',\n",
       " ' Definitely go for the guided tour This lacks the grandeur of Gyeongbukgung but I liked the serene feel of this palace  especially if you go for the Suwon. The area open to public is quite small  as majority of the land is within the secret garden tour. Actually  you can t explore the whole place even with the secret garden tour but it was worth the extra pay.',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Palace Although this is a  secondary  palace it is no less of a  must see  destination in Seoul. There is a beautiful park towards the back part of the palace grounds that is wonderful for walking.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden and Changdeokgung Palace Yes really similar to Gyeongbokgung palace but still nice to see and walk around. I also booked a tour to the secret garden  I booked it 4 days in advance  but I wouldn t recommend it in winter or early march april. We had a lovely english tour guide but the secret garden is nothing I haven t seen before and it can be hard for some people to walk up the steep hill. I would only go back to the secret garden in autumn other than that I would skip it to be honest.',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden Tour with friendly tour guide 2nd visit to this palace. But 1st time going for the Secret Garden tour. Just have to do online reservation in 1 week advance for which language the tour would be conducted in. Reach the palace at least 20 mins before tour starts to secure booking. Went during Spring time  and trees look bare. Scenery would have been beautiful in Autumn. Secret Garden tour took around 1.5 hours to finish and there are up down slopes to take on which might be tricky for elderly. It s still manageable to walk at your own pace  just that will be missing out on the introduction of the corners. Friendly tour guide are more than willing to share and answer queries which you might have for the sites. Would love to be back during Autumn!',\n",
       " ' Beautiful! So many things to say about the palace it definitely deserves a visit. I went on a Friday so I was able to buy the tickets including the pass for the Secret Garden on site . I know you can book online but somehow it wouldn t work on my phone nor iPad. Prepare to spend at least 3 hours on this site. The garden was so beautiful  words fail to describe its beauty  so here are some pictures. ',\n",
       " ' One of the must see sights in Seoul The palace is one of the sights you need to see if you visit Seoul. It s historic and evocative  although the actual building interiors and surroundings are a bit austere and lifeless  as opposed to a more full functioning actual monastery. The buildings themselves have been very nicely restored  however  and the grounds are impressive. Since the palace is right downtown it is easily accessible by subway  downtown hotels  etc. Seeing only this sight palace  as opposed to something more current and vibrant for the modern population would be a mistake  but if you have a few hours this is the kind of place that gives a sense for the history of Korea. It is also possible to rent traditional costumes nearby which can lend a novel flavor to your trip  and your photos  so long as you are willing to play the part and simultaneously feel a bit ridiculous.',\n",
       " ' The Best Palace Tour by Far Changdoekgung is by far the best preserved palace in Seoul. While Gyeongbukgung is more famous  it has been altered more. I suggest you take the English speaking tour for your 1st visit  there are usually 2 or more a day. The tour takes you through the grounds and into a couple of the buildings  but more importantly takes you too the Hidden Gardens  ponds  and summer retreat palace buildings. Korean landscaping is much more natural than other gardens. If you only have a couple days in Seoul  I put this high on the list of places to go. It is in central Seoul and close to Gyeongboekgung  Insadong  City Hall  Myeongdong  and Namdaenum. ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Garden and palace The palace is lovely but the highlight is the secret garden. You need to join a guided tour  which isn t something we usually do  but the tour guide was interesting and easy to understand. We reserved our places on line  which was easy to do and can be done up to 6 days in advance. Tours in English are at 10.30  11.30  2.30 and 3.30. You do need to allow yourself 15 20 mins to walk from the main entrance gate to the start of the tour. If you are planning to visit the garden then you really should buy a combination ticket. This cost W10 000  less than 7  and includes entrance to the secret garden as well as entrance to four palaces and the royal shrine. Given that Changdeokgung Palace and Garden costs W8 000 together  the combo ticket is excellent value. You need to take your reservation details to the main ticket office to exchange it for a secret garden ticket before entering the palace.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace You really shouldn t miss the lovely Changdeokgung palace in Seoul  one of the five grand palaces built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. The buildings are wonderful  colorful and impressive  but the highlight of my visit to the palace grounds was no doubt the guided walk through the Secret Garden. Make sure to include this in your visit! The guide was very knowledgeable and spoke excellent English. I visited the gardens in early March  but would love to go back in spring  summer or fall to enjoy the changing colors of the beautiful trees and flowers. Must be quite a sight! Highly recommended. A must visit when in Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Must see if in seoul We actually stumbled on this palace by accident I wanted to go to the main palace but this closes on Tuesdays so said we would go to this as we were on our last day  the secret garden is a must  try reserve a tour online before you go  day before  as we were not able to do the tour but luckily got tickets to wander about ourselves. Stunning. ',\n",

       " ' Spring is a great time to see the secret garden We missed the English tour and you can only tour the secret gardens as part of one of the palace s official tours  but we had a great private tour guide who sweet talked them into letting us join the Korean language tour. We would have had a great time enjoying the sites with a regular guide but our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the site  she used to work there  and the colour and history she added really makes all the difference in understanding the structure  the design and history including impacts of the Japanese occupation   don t cut your experience short  a good tour guide really makes all the difference.',\n",
       " ' Wonderful tour with guide application It was wonderful place especially in spring! I can see a Korean palace with beautiful sky in harmony. Actually I considered to visit Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung just befort a day of visit. But I m sure Changdeokgung is better because I ve heard several comments about Gyeonbokgung that there are too much people to enjoy that place. However Changdeokgung is good enough to enjoy the gung with nice weather  beautiful building and so on. And I recommend to use an application the  Real  Changdeokgung  which guides you based on your location. It is very helpful to tour Changdeokgung. Alwasy it s true that  Your knowledge determines your insight.  At that point  it was awesome and to wonderful application to visit Changdeokgung.',\n",
       " ' Great palace with Korean architecture!! Beautiful and super big palace  you have to walk a lot but you can t miss. The Korea architecture is really good with use of bright colours onto the building. It s really good to see local people visiting palaces in colourful traditional dress !! Must visit place !! ',\n",
       " ' Nice garden We visited Changdeokgung Palace based on a recommendation and to visit the Secret Garden. To visit required to two tickets or you can get a ticket for W 10 000 which allows visits to other palaces. The palace is a UNESCO heritage sight. However the walk in the Secret Garden was lovely   a bit of an oasis in the middle of Seoul. It would have been even nicer in earlier spring or fall as the leaves would be lovely. A nice way to get a bit of exercise. ',\n",
       " ' Princess in the palace My friends and I decided to have a hanbok experience. We rented our hanbok from one of the rental shop nearby the palace. Our rental was only for 2 hours  so we decided to hurriedly explore the palace. When wearing hanbok  the entrance fee to the palace is FREE! It s better to come early to the palace ground to beat the crowd! I didn t get time to enter the famous secret garden  but i believe it s beautiful. The palace ground itself is really beautiful. Showing the grand and elegance of the Jeoson dynasty. Some of the king s collections can be seen. Also  we can see interesting side of an actual weatern bed that the king used at the end of the japanese occupation in Korea.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Secret Garden The palace is not as big as the Gyeongbukgong but the highlight of this place is the beautiful huwon. Best to go on a tour to see this. You pay a little more but you get treated to some  secret spots  that are normally not accessible with the regular entrance ticket. We went early to queue for the English tour at 10 30 on a Sunday. Or you can reserve on their website a week before visiting and just pay upon pick up. ',\n",
       " ' Easily accessible from Angus station. Worth a visit! The secret garden should be more interesting during the fall ! The different types of trees would certainly be a feast for the eyes! Foliage was all green only when I visited. The entrance fee was 3 000 won  and there is a separate charge to enter the secret garden  5000 won  It would be nice to get 1 or 2 k won discount if buy it together though! The palace itself is interesting as the orientation differs from most other palaces. Changyunggung can be accessed inside the palace. Entrance of 1000 won can be purchased at gate  and with proof of the changdeokgung ticket stub  can re enter from the same place . Worth to do it together .',\n",
       " ' Visit the Secret Garden This palace is beautiful and it is a more manageable size. It was a quiet day in October when I visited and the Secret Garden tour made it more special. English tours are available and they sold out fast  so plan the trip in advance. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and patient  gave everybody an opportunity to ask question and take pictures. It was beautiful and also a bit sad to see the pound in the format of the unified Koreas  South and North  and makes you wish that one day they become the same country again. It is a lot of walking up and downhill and the tour ends in a place where you need to climb uneven stairs but it is manageable',\n",

       " ' Amazing I appreciate Korean Palaces so much because it shows how much they treasure their history. It was well preserved and strictly kept clean  and thus it has become a highly respected place. I wish the Philippines valued its history as much as Koreans did.   ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Space The palace is great but the secret garden is definitely worth it. Only a few dollars to walk though gorgeous greenery.',\n",

       " ' Free English guided tour We followed the free English guided tour  she really adds to the experience by explaining the history behind the raised stone walkway to the clever secret of the dragon heads on the roof top. The tours are only at set times so make you check out the times before you go. The palace itself and the picturesque gardens really give you a good idea of the lifestyle and culture of the people that once lived there. You might also see many Korean couples dress in the traditional attire  hanbok   walking around posing for photos. It s a common Korean couple activity as well as for wedding photos.',\n",
       " ' A Must See Got here just in time to roam around the outside of the palace and see the displays of the old tools and homes. The place is very nice. We did not go in to the museum but you get to learn a lot of the heritage from the outside too. Must witness the changing of the guard which we caught at 1pm.',\n",
       " ' The most beautiful palace in Seoul The palace was only 10 15 minutes on foot from Anguk subway station. It might be the most beautiful one in Seoul. The cherry blossom was everywhere in the palace at the time we were visiting it. Walking around it might take less than an hour but we decided to slowly do so with resting and feeling the breeze of history blowing on us. So much enjoyful and peaceful!',\n",

Plus we had the benefit of a superb display by the many guards in a multiplicity of colours completing some form of historic routine which lasted over one hour. 100 s of school kids were sitting down in attendance and enjoying the glorious display by so many. We then received free entry as Seniors to The Palace and we enjoyed the Palace buildings that were restored in 1834   after a number of fires had mostly destroyed the original buildings which had commenced in 1484. During the Japanese occupation the Palace name was changed to   Changgyeongwon and in 1986 the South Korean Government restored The Palace to its original state and changed its name back to   Changgyeonggung Palace. More young and older ladies in costume and lots of photos opportunities with the beautiful flowers   including lots of Cherry Blossoms. A great place to visit and is highly recommended ',\n",
       " ' Secret Garden Tour. went there specifically for the renowned Secret Garden sights end of March  the cherry blossom season. You gotta pay extra for this Secret Garden guided tour  as they wont let you in by yourself. otherwise you just pay for the general admission fee. Seem wearing a Hanbok will get you some discount on the entrance fee. the old heritage building is well maintained and upon entering we were greeted by 2 blooming white cherry blossom tree. there were a few more pink cherry blossom further in. as for the Secret Garden tour  very informative tour guide and very friendly. there are different language tour session  so know when is preferred time slots. Was a disappointed though with the scenery as the flowers are not in bloom and the trees are still withered from winter. Be prepared for a little up slope hike. Really choose your visiting season well or else be disappointed. Tour guide recommend to visit during full blown spring  authumn and winter  with snow covering the land  to enjoy the place true beauty. perhaps 1 day will revisit again.',\n",

You can purchase the package at any of the palaces ticket offices. The guided tour is informative and you will be given time for photos and a short break. You won t regret it!

       " ' A great way to start your historical tour of S.Korea It was my first time to visit Seoul and apart from the Food Tour  I haven t been to any historical places. This was located by a main road in the city so it was easy to access. The place is not crowded  very spacious inside and will provide you with a lot of understanding about the Buddhist way of life. This good be done through a tour guide who can provide valuable insights as you visit one site to another.',\n",
       " ' Secret garden Visited the palace because of the secret garden which requires a booking. The secret garden is big and spectacular. How I wish to be the emperor back in the times to enjoy the palace',\n",
       " ' Reproduction of the Palance This palace was built in 2005. It shows the style of the period  but on a cold January day  seemed rather bleak  with nothing but similar style  empty buildings. One building had a lovely painted ceiling  and I believe there is a wonderful garden in better weather.',\n",
       " ' Interesting and open Enjoyed our day here. Some interesting culture and open buildings but all a bit same after a while. Still I d recommend a visit.',\n",
       " ' Changing of the Guard ceremony Tourists from around the world at the ceremony changes imperial guard. Changing the Guard  accompanied by drums and parade in traditional costumes with military equipment and flags. After the ceremony  walk along the complex imperial palace.',\n",
       " ' Lovely palace! Nice and quiet palace for great photo. Joined the secret garden tour. Good stamina is essential as there are many slopes and kinda steep. The garden is very beautiful though some works is going on at certain places. Lovely maple and ginkgo tree in the compound. Great experience to figure out how was the old times royal family life. Impressive!',\n",
       " ' Go to the Secret Garden  Back Garden ! This is a magnificent royal palace and a must see in Seoul. The secret garden tour was very interesting and beautiful  I highly recommend taking the guided tour on it.',\n",
       " ' A half day trip to Changdeokgung Palace This is one of the smaller palace in Seoul. The main attraction is Huwon  better known as Secret Garden  but more appropriately known as a the Rear Back Garden . It is difficult to plan efficiently for this trip as the English guided tour would clash with the Huwon tour. I had the Huwon tour followed by a self guided walk through the remaining palace compound. You should be a able to cover this within half a day. After the trip  it would be nice to take a stroll at the nearby Bukchon to see traditional Korean houses. Stop by one of the hill top teahouses to warm up and charge your phones while enjoying tea and the evening city views. Be prepared to put on good walking shoes and to spare the remaining half of the day at this area.',\n",
       " ' A Taste of History We had a great time exploring the palace grounds with a tour guide who gave us the detailed history. The Changing of the Guard ceremony was interesting to watch   a colorful spectacle of traditional drums and march set in the main courtyard. Definitely a site to see if you visit Seoul!',\n",
       " ' A nice afternoon and walk through the garden We had an excellent afternoon including a secret garden tour. Without the tour I think it would be hard to enjoy or learn much during a visit  but the information and history provided by the guide during our 75 minute tour were really interesting and nice. Perhaps the group size was bigger than it should have been  but anyway it was a nice afternoon and without the tour it would have been a big disappointment.',\n",
       " ' Amazing experience! I went there on a very cold day  7c with my friends  the palace is full of stories for visitors to relive again  our Tour guid Ms. Kim was very nice and very smart  she made sure that all of us are enjoying the tour. ',\n",
       " ' Palace with its  secret garden  Not as huge and  sprawling   way to the back  as Gyeongbokgung and also not as  brightly colorful  with ceremonial guards and big guard ceremony as at Gyeongbokgung  saw no ceremonial guard whatsoever at the gate here   the  highlight  of this palace that sets it apart from all the other palaces is its so called  Secret Garden   a.k.a. Huwon  all the way at the back which is actually a  big park  with grown trees  some ponds  beautiful small pavilions   and a pretty big pavilion on a high ground which is off limits to the public  and an enclosed area with these traditional wooden row buildings forming a perimeter  guess it was like a royal resting place back in the day when they were in the garden  and also learned that the Joseon kings and queens actually took part in planting of trees and such activities  maybe as called for by the royal customs and tradition   I went in with the 12 pm Korean tour  missed my 11 am or 1130 am English tour  which took an hour and a half but it was such a  well timed and comfortable  tour with only like a 10 minute walk at most between every two stops  about six stops in total  and places to sit down at each stop  so an hour and a half went by  quite pleasantly . Another part of interest on the palace grounds is the residential area at the far end on one side  a left turn from the main pathway past the main palace building with the throne stage  or a right turn after coming out of the tour of the Secret Garden  where the last emperor of Korea and his wife after him spent their last years during the Japanese occupation. And a little  out of the way  from the rest of the Palace because it s on the other side of the main pathway from the rest of the Palace  a right turn from the main pathway just before getting to the Garden entrance  or a left turn after coming out of the Garden tour  is an enclosed area which was the place for the concubine of one of the Joseon kings. Coming by subway  Anguk Station  on Line 3  is the nearest one with just a 5 to 10 minute walk east straight on the big Yulgok ro St. to this palace. There s also the royal residence  not a palace  called Unhyeongung between the station and this palace  but you ll have to do a slight detour by turning right and walking a short distance to get there after coming out of the station . And right beside this palace is another palace called Changgyeonggung which you can actually  very conveniently  get to by going out the back exit  right beside the Secret Garden entrance  where you ll get to the high ground overlooking Changgyeonggung with stairs to go down to that palace. As for the ticket  I suggest getting an  integrated ticket  for 10 000 won which is good for a month and which covers this palace and three other palaces namely the main palace Gyeongbokgung  Changgyeonggung  right beside here as mentioned above  and Deoksugung plus Jongmyo Shrine  also just in the vicinity of this palace   and do keep in mind that this palace along with Changgyeonggung and Deoksugung are closed on Mondays and Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays.',\n",
       " ' Definitely a worthwhile visit... Changdeok Palace is one of my favorite palaces out of the 4 main palaces in Seoul because it houses the Secret Garden. While all the other buildings and corners within the Changdeok Palace premises are pretty and worth seeing  I highly recommend that any new visitors also include a walk through the Secret Garden  which require joining a tour group and paying an entrance fee of KRW 5000 per adult. The tour takes about an hour and is provided in different languages. It s a good idea to check the schedule beforehand. It is fun to hear about the history related to each of the areas within the Palace. The different pavillions are also quite fascinating to see. Also  the Palace is known to have a different look in each season  each unique and each equally worth the visit. It is also conveniently situated near the Seoul central business district. Hope you enjoy!                                       .                      .                                                             . ',\n",
       " ' A secret surprise ... the secret garden Beautiful palace. It was one of my favourite palace due to the fact that it had the secret garden. It is a bit of a walk so do remember to take water with you and wear good walking shoes. The back lake has the most beautiful view and great for taking photos. Beautiful place to go as a couple.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful preservatioon The palace has a lot of history..This is a must visit when in Seoul. The Bus and or the subway will get you there',\n",
       " ' Changdeokgung Palace   visited November 2016   went just a few hours before closing time  so there was no crowd  and it was quiet and peaceful   better if you purchase the Royal Palace Pass worth 10000 won  which grants access to this palace  plus Gyeongbokgung  Changgyeonggung  Deoksugung  and Jongmyo',\n",
       " ' Best spot for maples I have been to Changdeokgung for many times. It is the best place for maples. If you want to enjoy autumn blaze maple  you definitely cannot miss the secret garden. Please make online reservation in advance. ',\n",
       " ' Great place to explore the beauty of autumn in Seoul Visit this palace in the late autumn. Great chance for autumn leaves viewing when discover secret garden. To sight seeing the secret garden  you need to reserve the ticket online or buy on sight at ticket box soon.',\n",
       " ' Travelling Alone If you are traveling alone or you need places that are private  you can go here as you can enjoy the views of Korean palace by yourself. This place is less crowded so it will be easy for you to get into the history of Changdeokgung easily. Wearing hanbok is also free here and you can get some relax.',\n",
       " ' it s just ok I am definitely biased  but you have been to the forbidden city in Beijing or any of the imperial palaces in China  you really don t need to visit any of the palaces in Seoul  I think. At least with Changdeokung  I found it small  uninteresting and unimpressive. Architecturally  it s similar to the Chinese palaces. The names are in Chinese as well. I really felt like I was in China. ',\n",
       " ' historical This is a little smaller than others but it has a lot of history. There are signs explaining everything and they are in English. some of the buildings have some furniture inside but not may. It is worth it so come and visit.',\n",
       " ' One of the 2 Cultural Heritage Site at Seoul It surrounds with high level of wall  and locates at the heart of the city  really fusion with modern buildings around. Be alert that  it close on Monday. It is calm  scenic and comes in solid culture ambience.',\n",
       " ' Love it! Fell in love with this Palace  specially with its Secret Garden. The admission fee is 3000 KRW and 5000 KRW for entering Secret Garden. I went there 2 times because on my first visit I didn t get the ticket for Secret Garden. And worth to come back Please use comfortable shoes.',\n",
       " ' Interesting place to learn history Recommended for families and couples who do not like shopping. Great place to learn about korea culture and history while taking in the scenic views.',\n",
       " ' Nice and quiet palace Although this palace is smaller than gyeongbokgung  but it is well preserved and lesser tourist here. The structure and design of the palace are pretty similar as Gyeongbokgung. I would prefer this palace than Gyeongbokgung. ',\n",
       " ' A palace with lovely garden We also join The Secret Garden tour with english speaking guide. Really worth it cause the garden are beautiful and serene. I think may be during autumn this palace will be more beautiful.',\n",
       " ' The oldest palace besides Gyeongbokgung In this palace  there haveany trees and surrounding was awesome. I believe if during Spring or Autumn  you could see beautiful colors of flowers and red leaves surrounding this palace. A secret garden a must visit spot besides having a massive long walk to this garden of silent. A little pond and resting place will be good for a snapshot or wefie or selfie is memorable. Apart from this wonderful place  there s a little cafe that you can drop by to check out beautiful souvenirs. You can have a cuppa too! Trust me  this is really a nice palace that I love to visit again next time. Thanks to our private tour guide from Top Korea Tour  Juno who explained the historical part of this palace and we were like adventurers exploring the place in and out. Found a little secret locked place you can find out yourself when you are there. My mom was cooling resting at the cafe enjoying the view of trees. Totally different feeling from other palaces. For those who appreciate history or architecture designs  you would love what you see. For others  just visit this place to get to know more.',\n",
       " ' Just another palace   Huwon garden is special The palace could be more beautiful during fall  but I visited in winter so it looked the same with other palaces. We booked the huwon garden tour  and again  the tour guide said that the garden was much more beautiful during fall. In winter  it is all snow and frozen ponds. It was nice to hear the tour guide leading us through history  though.',\n",
       " ' Increble Beautiful. It is a must! And the English guide tour was just perfect. Very detailed information and perfect english',\n",
       " ' Take the guided tours It is better to buy the Combination ticket that costs W10 000 and gives admission to 5 sites and Secret Garden. During peak seasons  it is advisable to book for guided tours via their online portal. The schedule for the guided tours are listed online for easier planning. You can also walk around the plalace ground except the Secret Garden. The guided tour of Secret Garden is highly recommended. Our tour guide was excellent in presenting the history and features of the Secret Garden.',\n",
       " ' Best palace to visit in Seoul Go on a guided tour of this palace which the Kings of Korea preferred over Gyeongbuk Palace for its feng shui. The palace was not at all crowded on a Tuesday afternoon last week. Make sure you get there early enough to visit Biwon  the Secret Garden  which closes at 4 00 pm',\n",
       " ' nice palace Walking here from Myeongdong was reasonable. There is a small admission fee to explore the grounds. We liked looking at the different buildings. The bathrooms were updated and very clean  which was surprising considering what a big tourist attraction it is.',\n",
       " ' A smaller palace that doesn t take much time We went there because it was close to the hotel. It s really pushed as breathtaking but it s not. It s a smaller version of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It s also a replica. The origami was destroyed and this was rebuilt strictly for tourists. It s buildings only  no furniture or anything else that would help you imagine what life would have been like. The good thing is that it s free for seniors. ',\n",
       " ' The BEST of the palaces. The palace has a garden inside that is so beautiful. It is only available to ticket holders who are in a group tour. It is possible to reserve tickets in adavance for the garden tour  and I highly suggest doing so since it will likely sell out. I think they offer tours in Korean  English  Chinese  and Japanese. I ve only been on the English tour  and the guides were so helpful and provided unique and interesting facts both times I ve gone. I really can t stress enough how lovely this place is. The garden tour is a bit of a walk though  and it does go up and down hills and stairs quite a bit. Just be aware that you ll walk a bit on the tour  but it s worth it.',\n",
       " ' Well preserved and restored Like the other palace  the place is well preserved and restored. I would have enjoyed myself more if there were more signages and explanation boards to indicate and describe to visitors of the various locations of the palace  since I did not join any guided tour groups. I ended up walking to places where there were just closed up rooms. Due to time constraint  I missed the Secret Garden that needed a separate ticket  probably do it on my next visit.',\n",
       " ' lovely so interesting and full of history. Cannot believe you are standing at a Palace built so long ago with such ancient traditions.',\n",
       " ' Winter views are not really as good Changdeokgung Palace is worth the visit considering that it is a UNESCO world heritage site. The temples and open spaces are not as grand as the newer Gyeongbokgung Palace  but its charm is rooted in the simplicity and humility of the structure and in the magnificent lay out of the secret garden  accessible upon payment of additional 5 000 KRW . The views of the palace and the garden  however  are not as breath taking as the views during spring or autumn. With all humility  winter views are only great if snow is thick and not yet melting. During our visit  snow is already melting  and all that s left were leafless trees and frozen ponds. Consolation comes from our tour guide who shared interesting trivia about the palace and gardens.',\n",
       " ' Royal abode While Kyeoungbok gung is a workibg quarters for the King  this place is the actual living quarters for the royal family. Much restoration has been done to correct Japanese mischief during the occupation. It s a cosy and pretty place  a palace',\n",
       " ' Beautiful to behold It is not only beautiful to behold   but even your imagination is captivated by the rich history of every structure in the Palace grounds. All the Royal Palaces are beautiful to behold ... Korea is a beautiful country with very hospitable people',\n",
       " ' Walking through the times I love history and looking at architecture. Hence  visiting the palaces in South Korea is a must. You can visit Changdeokgung  Changgyeonggung  Gyeongbokgung and Deoksugung at 10 000KRW by purchasing the combined ticket. This also includes Jongmyo shrine which I did not visit as I m not interested. Visiting in Winter is definitely cold and you won t be able to see the pretty flowers and beautiful green scenery  if you want to see those  the in house guide said spring autumn is good . But it gives another sense of imagination as the in house guide brings you around the palaces   the reality of power struggle within the palace   together with the cold winter. Architecture and the reason why certain places were built are interesting too. Definitely a must visit if you want to go deeper into the history of Korea. Of course  you won t become an expert at it but at least a good understanding if you follow through the guide or simply just download the app for each palaces and just walk through it by reading.',\n",
       " ' Beauty secret garden It long hard journey to come there by walking.. the secret garden there very beauty...scarlet heart actress are acting there... it worth to come.  many of historical evidence you may learn.. i love the tour guide explanation all about the secret garden..please come there in the 4 season..the beauty views for 4 season are different..i suggest come on spring. All flower bloom and winter also you may see the frozen lake...',\n",
       " ' Korean Palace This was our first activity in Seoul and it was a wonderful introduction into Korean history and architecture. It was raining the entire time that we were there so we did not do the secret garden. Luckily the rain did not ruin the experience of the palace.',\n",
       " ' Cant wait to visit again! This palace is much smaller than Gyeong Bok palace  but you will definately get a more out of this gem. Changdeok Palace has a garden that is only accesible through tour groups formed at the tocket booth. It is unnecessary to make reservaions if you are in a party under four  they offer walking tours in English  Chinese and Japanese. The royal garden is full of ancient trees  beautiful architecture and landscaping that is particular to the Korean culture  it is less tended and more close to a forest than a typical western garden. Don t hesitate to go on this tour as it is worth your money and time!',\n",
       " ' Beautiful The pity thing is that we came there on a cold rainy day. Anyway  we still really enjoy the beautiful peaceful scenery of Changdeokgung Palace. This place is huge  make sure to follow the guides  otherwises we will get lost. We were there in April  so there re cherry blossoms blossoming. There re many other beautiful flowers in the palace too. Great place to enjoy peace  nature and take photos.',\n",
       " ' If you need to pick a palace   come here! It s not the biggest  but in my opinion is the most beautiful! The palaces are all somewhat similar but the secret garden tour makes this one stand out from the rest. If your short on time  make this palace a priority! It may not be ask we ll known as the main palace but it is stunning! ',\n",
       " ' excelent history preserved This palace complex is a good example how Korea preservs its history. Very well conserved. Those palace are a historic mark of the glorious period of Joseon Dynasty in Korea  from 1392 to 1910. Its offer two english tours in the morning and two or three in the afternoon depends on the period of the year. For foreigners is mandatory to take the English tour.',\n",
       " ' Palace with Secret garden Really large palace  there is a secret garden but you can only visit with tour guide  dont miss it and check to tour guide time for it not expencive',\n",
       " ' Beautiful to visit in spring and summer Interesting palaces and gardens. Unfortunately in February no flowers or leaves on trees so the beauty of the gardens could not be seen. Good guides  especially my group had a very good guide for the Secret Garden tour. The Secret Garden tour is limited to groups of max 100 persons. Plenty of walking so not good for people with limited mobility. Not fun to visit on a rainy day.',\n",
       " ' Great treasure  Secret Garden was beautiful While smaller in size to the grand palace of Gyeongbokgung this is indeed a little treasure. Don t miss the secret Garden it is an extra admission and tickets can be brought outside the entrance of the Secret Garden towards the back of the palace grounds. We were lucky to go late November and the fall foliage was beautiful. The Secret Garden is by tour only. If you appreciate history  learning about Korean royalty history or architecture designs you will love this. ',\n",
       " ' Wonderful! We visited the Changdeokgung Palace as a part of the day trip in Seoul. It is a compex of beautifusl  historical palaces that unfold a rich Korean history. No wonder it is a UNESCO preserved heritag sight. This is a must see while visiting Seoul.',\n",
       " ' Don t miss the secret garden We visited Changdeokgung Palace in November and the fall foliage was beautiful  especially in the secret garden area. Make sure that you get the ticket that admits you to this area  which is at the back of the palace grounds. A must visit site when touring Seoul!',\n",
       " ' Nice outdoor Korean history lesson Overall it was a great experience. Take a lot of photos!! If you re wondering whether or not you should pay the extra buck for Secret Garden  do not hesitate  do it. I visited in the winter and Secret Garden was the highlight of my day. Enjoy beautiful views and architecture while you listen to the tour guide s explanation of why each section of the palace existed    but it does involve a lot of walking and climbing up some stairs  especially during the winter it could be a little harder for older visitors. We spent more time there than originally planned. ',\n",
       " ' Probably the best of the Palaces Really impressive from an architectural viewpoint  with a number of different palaces for the King  the Queen and Concubines. The Secret Garden is a joy  extra charge though  and should be at its best in the Spring. Great place to escape the turmoil of modern day Seoul. ',\n",
       " ' Historical Interesting  but quite a walk not recommended for elderlies. Might be great on summer as flower are bloomed.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful and well preserved First impression was it was like the other palaces  sculptured tiles and painted roofs. Going on a little farther  one came to a part that looked humbler but actually more beautiful. Plain carved wooden wall and roof. This was built for a concubine and done not to stoked the jealousy of the queen. Would love to come here in warmer clime to see the garden.',\n",
       " ' It s a nice palace Very good architecture  worth a trip to understand the culture. You can also walk into the deeper end to see the secret garden and the secondary palace for added charge  boooo.... . ',\n",
       " ' Garden closed today Running second best to Gyeongbokgung this palace still has a thing or two and can hold its own. I really wanted to do the secret garden but it was closed on the day that I visited.',\n",
       " ' Must book the secret garden tour. Those that come here should see the secret garden as well. This palace is quite plain in the winter. The palace felt dull by the lack of colors. ',\n",
       " ' What a place!!! You can t miss this place. Make sure you go there with lots of time  i would say at least 3hours  to explore the area. And please wear comfartable clothes and shoes because you will be walking a LOT. Paying for the guided tour is important for you to learn a lot the local history. Take time to choose a quiet spot  sit down and observe Korea people who goes there. You would be amazed how much you can learn by observing the way they interact with each other  how they respect their culture and people. I was truly amazed!!!',\n",
       " ' Probably the Best UNESCO World Heritage in Seoul Among the palaces we visited in Seoul  this is my favorite. Great architecture. Feels like I was in one of the Saeguk dramas. Don t miss the Secret Garden and Deoksugung within the complex.',\n",
       " ' Lovely palace with great photo opportunities This is a historically significant and beautiful palace to visit during a trip to Seoul. We saw this palace along with others on a tour for people associated with the American military and their families. It is beautiful in the fall and offers many great photo opportunities.',\n",
       " ' Exploring This palace has much to explore  almost every corner has a magical photo opportunity! Especially with all the pretty girls wearing their traditional clothes. Many are more than happy to pose for you  if you ask nicely! We spent around 3 hours walking around all the small buildings and stopped for coffee in the cafe on the grounds   decent coffee  not overpriced at 3500won . ',\n",
       " ' Beautiful Palace Settings the palace is 5 minutes walk from Anguk station  exit 1. Fortunately during my visit  I ve been granted by free admission as the palace open for free on the last Wednesday of every months. The temperature was very cold as i visited the place during the winter and i suggest you to avoid winter if you wish to fully explore the beauty of the palace. Winter also not too bad as the scenery was stunning  the roofs covers by white fresh snow that make the buildings looks lovely and romantic. But due to negative temperature  it will limit your steps to explore the entire boundary. Believe me  it is worth to at least pay a visit once to this landmark  you will not regret.',\n",
       " ' excellent very beautiful palace  however  you have to purchase separate ticket if you want to visit backyard garden. i personally think the garden is not so special during winter. they do provide free tour guide in chinese  korean and english. very good service. if you have time  rent traditional korean costume from shops outside the palace will make this trip more memorable. and if i m not wrong  you can enter this palace for free if you are wearing Korean Hanbok. ',\n",
       " ' The Palace with the Secret Garden I chose to go to only this Palace since it s on the UNESCO heritage site list and it also boasts a very beautiful Secret Garden. On the day that I was there  it rained before and as I was leaving the Palace. It s a very beautiful place to go even if just for the garden. I liked that while there were many people there  it wasn t crowded. I bought a ticket for the Secret Garden so there would be a guided tour. The guide wasn t very proficient in English so it was difficult to grasp what he was trying to say. It is easy enough to enjoy the Garden without a guide anyway.',\n",
       " ' Beautiful palace. Alluring secret garden. My favorite palace. Went 3 times! Really like this palace. I bought a combination ticket but it was not enough for me  I went 3 times! Go early in the morning 9am on a weekday and you practically get the whole palace to yourself. Walk around and immerse in its beauty and serenity. Definitely join a guided tour to know more about the grounds. Check their website for timings for various language guided tours. We went for the 10 30am English tour. Very nice. It ends just in time at 11 20am for you to catch the 11 30am secret garden guided tour. The secret garden is only available on guided tour  with extra ticket  so check online for secret garden reservations or go early to book a spot at the ticket counter. It s worth a visit so don t miss out. Although many buildings are new  as the originals were burnt down during the Japanese war  it s still an interesting place to visit. Recommended! ',\n",
       " ' Korea in the olden days It s for the historical and  or archaeological freak. Cobbled walk corridors  muddy open courtyards  snow covered parks  roof that has its corners flipped and curled upwards towards the sky. It s a little too cold for visiting in the winter. It s probably a nice sight in spring when all the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. Nonetheless it still has its charm with snow covered roofs. ',\n",
